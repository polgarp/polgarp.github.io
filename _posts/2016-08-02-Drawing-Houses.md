#### User Story Mapping at Emarsys

I gave a brown bag [talk about user story mapping](https://prezi.com/6t76xvoiprc8/user-story-mapping/) recently at Emarsys. After a bit of promotion, more and more of our teams start to use this method, so this was good occasion to review why we like it, to share some learnings, and to show some basic guidelines and principles to consider when using it.

As user story mapping is a very general method, I do recommend everyone to read [the excellent book by Jeff Patton](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033851.do) on the topic. But it turns out that when working with similar teams inside one organisation it’s not really useful to always say “it depends on your team/product/problem” to whatever questions people have. There are more similarities than differences between the teams, and people would like to have more concrete recipes to get started. Because of this I decided to talk about some baseline ideas and introduce a kinda fixed process, while still leaving room for people to iterate and customize as they need. So here are my basic ingredients for using user story mapping.

## About the Houses…

One of the toughest thing in introducing new methods is to actually convince people to participate. Even more so with user story mapping, as the biggest advantage of the method is not the actual map that is being created, but rather the shared understanding formed through discussions within the team. Maybe the maps they have already seen were not as impressive or they didn’t consider it as useful. Some may consider this time spent “not working” (=talking) as wasteful. So my first point was to do a short exercise. I asked people present to grab a post-it, and draw a house in 1 minute.

I really liked the results. There was a wide variety of houses, with different windows, doors, chimneys, some had drawn additional trees, sun or smoke. Such variety, such diverse ideas.

This was not a perfect analogy, I cheated a bit. Usually when creating software you have more details on what to do, and most of the time you also have to collaborate with others so you have to care for how your work fits with others’. But this wasn’t a big cheat, as it drove home the point: you shouldn’t assume everybody agrees what you are working on, and you should see how your tasks fit into the big picture.

You need to spend time on getting shared understanding.
