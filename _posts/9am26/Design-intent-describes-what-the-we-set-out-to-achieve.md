# ‚òï Design intent describes what the we set out to achieve

This might be familiar to some design leaders. One of the designer starts a new project. As design progresses, you review the work. "So what are you trying to do here?" "We need to create this table for that list of items." "No, I meant what's the goal? How will this fit to the user's journey?" "...". And this goes on - since the designer is unclear what they are trying to do (besides checking requirements), it's also unclear whether they've reached it. Which results in too many back and forth over supposed to be final designs.

At the core of this and similar situations is the lack of clear intentions. Both on the project level - the product team is unclear what they set out to do or at least they don't share a clear view. And also within the design process intention clarity lacks, design decisions should have a reason, but since the designer is unclear what they are trying to achieve, decisions are vague and don't have a clear foundation. Results are shallow, lots of talk about surface level changes, but disconnect from the wider context. If there is a little push, the whole solution topples, falls apart. Which ultimately leads to mediocre design.

Unfortunately the lack of clear intentions goes beyond the problems on the design's level. Since there is no unifying idea, that is shared by the whole team the overall UX will also suffer. Research insights might be overlooked, engineers make trade-offs that contradicts with what the designer wanted to do, marketing and support will be misaligned. 

Before design starts, the problem to be solved should be clearly understood - by the designer and by the whole team. Often at the starting point of a project just a few vague sentences are known or some scattered research materials, or some data charts not increasing enough. When designing, the tactical aspect of diving int Figma is not the most valuable aspect, but the relation between understanding and creating.

Design is not art and not something the designer does on their own in Figma. Design should be the rendering of intent, that is the shared intent by the whole product team (and anybody else contributing). So what's intent exactly? It's he goal we are pursuing within the context. It needs to be a shared intent, a common understanding in the team what they are doing, as design does not happen in isolation. Discovery is not only about discovering the solutions, but also discovering the problem, and what the team will do about it, articulating the shared intent.

I've used two ways of defining intent in the past, by creating briefs and by working with hypotheses. Briefs work well as a high level description that summarizes research done and kicks of the design process. But they are not easily broken down into smaller pieces and connected to detail design decisions, so they are best used for check-ins and milestones. Hypotheses on the other hand fit well to be used within the process, as they can be broken down into smaller pieces and establish scaffolding for testing and validation.

Design briefs for designers working in product teams differ to what a creative agency would want to have. They don't need to extensively document project meta. Instead, a brief should describe goals of the project and what should be the focus - this also declares what is not the focus. Something that worked well for me in the past is to to have four sections in the brief: goals or main hypothesis, personas or jobs, scenarios or flows and [design principles]({% post_url 2023-02-12-Design-principles-set-the-foundation-for-good-design %}). This keeps it lightweight and flexible enough to have it in the top of mind in the project, and makes it easy to iterate on.

Hypothesis driven design works especially well if the wider team also uses hypotheses. Even without that, constantly keeping mind "what am I trying to do"-"why am I trying to do this"-"what do I expect this will do" is a useful mindset to have while designing. The 

Shared is an important aspect of having clear intentions. It's not enough if the designer knows what they are trying to do and how design decisions are connected to the goals. The rest of the team also needs to be on board. Since the designer is looking for a foundation of design work, getting the team to articulate the shared intent often falls on the designer. A good way to make sure there are no misunderstandings is to talk, a better way is to work through and prepare it together. Workshops typically work well.


This is also back and forth, intent might get clearer as we start building. Research needs to go into it. Understanding business goals as part of intent.



Once a clear intent is articulated, it can be used in a few waysAlso a basis for design critiques.

For design leaders, seeing intentions

# üç™ Things to snack on

**Jared Spool** wrote extensively about intent:
- **[Design is the Rendering of¬†Intent](https://articles.uie.com/design_rendering_intent/)** describes how design teams and product orgs should think about their process. I like this formulation a lot as it also clarifies what designers should be focused on. The article gives a few examples how user behavior and the team's goals to change it are connected.
- **[The Magical Short-Form Creative¬†Brief](https://articles.uie.com/short_form_creative_brief/)** is a description of intent I've used often in the past. By describing what the design is set out to achieve in a simple format, the whole team will be watching the same TV channel. This brief has four sections: Project objective, Key personas, Key scenarios, and Key principles. The article also gives a few examples how the brief should be used on team meetings and rituals.
- **LiRPPS: Lightweight, Research-Based Principles, Personas, and Scenarios** [part 1](https://articles.uie.com/lirpps/) and [part 2](https://articles.uie.com/lirpps_part2/): One disadvantage of having a brief is the perceived difficulty of creating it. The article outlines how the brief can be created on the basis of user research done in a few hours with some workshop exercises.

Design critiques are key to check if a design is at the right path to solve the goals it set out to reach. **Adam Connor** writes about how to set this goal in **[Setting the Foundation for Meaningful Critiques: Goals, Principles, Personas and¬†Scenarios](https://articles.uie.com/meaningful_critiques/)**. Since design critique is an analysis, the critique group needs to have a good understanding of what to evaluate against. Personas and scenarios provide background information, the lenses and context for the design. Goals and principles describe what the design tries to achieve. Sharing these to the critique group results in a deeper and more useful critique.

**Jake Burghardt** has a series about working with research insights. In **[Mapping existing research into design briefs and workflows ‚Äî to get more done with insights](https://medium.com/integrating-research/mapping-existing-research-into-design-briefs-and-workflows-to-get-more-done-with-insights-a5d79a850a91)** he describes how research can inform design direction, by adding insights into design briefs. This brings researchers into the design process at the right time and increases the impact of researchers. 

I liked the thoughts of **Caio Braga** about working with intent versus working without in **[Rendering intentionality](https://uxdesign.cc/rendering-intentionality-1a57df40b585)**. He argues that many designers and design team focus on rendering requests, that is designing features. By not having clear intentions, there is no focus on user needs, and while the product expands, ultimately issues won't get resolved. Designers should care about impact of their work and not the work itself.

**Andrew Duckworth** describes how to use hypothesis to describe design intent in **[Hypothesis driven design](https://grillopress.github.io/2017/12/10/hypothesis-driven-design.html)**. A lot of designers already work as having an idea and afterwards designing it to see if the idea works - so having a hypothesis and testing it, but they rarely write it down. Once it's a statement written down, it becomes an articulation of intent. Good hypotheses are testable and verifiable, adding a framework around guiding the designer's thinking. The article also gives a few example how this idea can be used in practice.
