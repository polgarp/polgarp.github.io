# ‚òï Design intent describes what the we set out to achieve

Two ways - the high level view (brief) and the strucutre view (hypothesis)


*5 practical questions you should answer when solving a design problem:  
  
1\. What are the root causes of the problem?  
  
2\. What are all of the potential consequences of the problem?  
  
3\. Who is affected by the problem?  
  
4\. What are some potential solutions to mitigate or control the problem?  
  
5\. What are the costs and benefits of each potential solution?  
  
Before jumping into a design, ensure you have done the work to understand the problem.  
  
Sometimes it‚Äôs surprising to see people jumping into a design with a very shallow understanding of the problem.  
  
The most valuable aspect of the solving problems with design isn‚Äôt the tactical process of creating a design but the idea of profoundly comprehending what you are trying to solve.*


Design is the rendering is intent, so what's intent exactly? The goal we are pursuing and minding the context. It also needs to be a shared intent, having a common understanding with the team what we are doing, as design is not in isolation. It's as much about discovering what we want to do. So part of product design is also understanding what the intent is.

Brief is often something design agencies get from clients and is more focused on general project context. But it's also a useful concept for in-house designers. 

This is also back and forth, intent might get clearer as we start building. Research needs to go into it.

Goal - should also talk about what success looks like, so focus on outcomes, behavior change, rather than desired output.

This is about stating the intent. Design is about rendering the intent, and it's more about the shared intent by the team. So first intent needs to be understood and then defined. 

Macro level - design briefs. But also on micro level, why are we adding UI elements or interactions. 

Also a basis for design critiques.

# üç™ Things to snack on

**Jared Spool** wrote extensively about intent:
- **[Design is the Rendering of¬†Intent](https://articles.uie.com/design_rendering_intent/)** is how best describes design teams and product orgs should think about their process. I like this formulation as this also clarifies what designers should be focused on. The article gives a few examples how user behavior and the team's goals to change it are connected.
- **[The Magical Short-Form Creative¬†Brief](https://articles.uie.com/short_form_creative_brief/)** is a description of intent I've been using often in the past. By describing what the design is set out to achieve in a simple format, the whole team will be watching the same TV channel. This brief has four sections: Project objective, Key personas, Key scenarios, and Key principles. The article also gives a few examples how the brief should be used on team meetings and rituals.
- **LiRPPS: Lightweight, Research-Based Principles, Personas, and Scenarios** [part 1](https://articles.uie.com/lirpps/) and [part 2](https://articles.uie.com/lirpps_part2/): One disadvantage of having a brief is the perceived difficulty of creating it. The article outlines how the brief can be created on the basis of user research done in a few hours with some workshop exercises.

Design critiques are key to check if a design is at the right path to solve the goals it set out to reach. **Adam Connor** writes about how to set this goal in **[Setting the Foundation for Meaningful Critiques: Goals, Principles, Personas and¬†Scenarios](https://articles.uie.com/meaningful_critiques/)**. Since design critique is an analysis, the critique group needs to have a good understanding of what to evaluate against. Personas and scenarios provide background information, the lenses and context for the design. Goals and principles describe what the design tries to achieve. Sharing these to the critique group results in a deeper and more useful critique.

**Jake Burghardt** has a series about working with research insights. In **[Mapping existing research into design briefs and workflows ‚Äî to get more done with insights](https://medium.com/integrating-research/mapping-existing-research-into-design-briefs-and-workflows-to-get-more-done-with-insights-a5d79a850a91)** he describes how research can inform design direction, by adding insights into design briefs. This brings researchers into the design process at the right time and increases the impact of researchers. 

I liked the thoughts of **Caio Braga** about working with intent versus working without in **[Rendering intentionality](https://uxdesign.cc/rendering-intentionality-1a57df40b585)**. He argues that many designers and design team focus on rendering requests, that is designing features. By not having clear intentions, there is no focus on user needs, and while the product expands, ultimately issues won't get resolved. Designers should care about impact of their work and not the work itself.

**Andrew Duckworth** describes how to use hypothesis to describe design intent in **[Hypothesis driven design](https://grillopress.github.io/2017/12/10/hypothesis-driven-design.html)**. A lot of designers already work as having an idea and afterwards designing it to see if the idea works - so having a hypothesis and testing it, but they rarely write it down. Once it's a statement written down, it becomes an articulation of intent. Good hypotheses are testable and verifiable, adding a framework around guiding the designer's thinking. The article also gives a few example how this idea can be used in practice.
