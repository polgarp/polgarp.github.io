# ‚òï Design intent describes what the we set out to achieve

Design is the rendering is intent, so what's intent exactly? The goal we are pursuing and minding the context. It also needs to be a shared intent, having a common understanding with the team what we are doing, as design is not in isolation. It's as much about discovering what we want to do. So part of product design is also understanding what the intent is.

Brief is often something design agencies get from clients and is more focused on general project context. But it's also a useful concept for in-house designers. 

This is also back and forth, intent might get clearer as we start building. Research needs to go into it.

Goal - should also talk about what success looks like, so focus on outcomes, behavior change, rather than desired output.

This is about stating the intent. Design is about rendering the intent, and it's more about the shared intent by the team. So first intent needs to be understood and then defined. 

Macro level - design briefs. But also on micro level, why are we adding UI elements or interactions. 

Also a basis for design critiques.

Hypothesis driven

Getting user research into intent
