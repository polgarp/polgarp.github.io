# ‚òï Combating groupthink

Products can fail because of many reasons. One of them being if the team ignores ideas or evidence and goes all in on an idea that in the end was not the right one. While there could be approach or organizational issues, a reason for failure is also if the team focuses too much on internal agreement, that is groupthink their decisions.

Groupthink is a phenomenon of social decision making, when the group members value internal harmony and lack of conflicts higher, than great outcomes. Because agreement can be based for example on the loudest voice, or the lowest common denominator, this can lead to mediocre decisions, lack of innovation and ultimately wasted resources.

The need of humans to be accepted by their groups makes this phenomenon extremely common in situations where disagreement might lead to social rejection. Since product development is usually a high pressure situation, there are quite frequent opportunities for this, in almost every step of the process, like interpreting research results, brainstorming ideas, prioritising, or reviewing design choices.

Why the group ends up with a mediocre choice is best understood from social dynamics, deadlines are tight, there is a lot of external pressure, there are dominant personalities in the team, dissent or disagreement isn't encouraged, or team is lacking diversity of thinking.

# üç™ Things to snack on

[Groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) by **Wikipedia**
Wikipedia as always has a good overview of the topic, adding some history too, including the insight that the effect is not that well researched and understood, but has plenty of anecdotal evidence. There is also a longer section on prevention, with some really nice advice, like inviting experts from outside of the group to get a different, outgroup perspective.
*Diversity of all kinds is also instrumental in preventing groupthink. Individuals with varying backgrounds, thought, professional and life experiences etc. can offer unique perspectives and challenge assumptions.*

[Groupthink: when collective decisions go wrong](https://nesslabs.com/groupthink) by **Dr. Hannah Rose**
A few more general examples of how groupthink impact our daily life, and strategies to avoid it (for example assigning some group members play devil's advocate). As in work situations, in non-business contexts it also helps to put a little structure into decisions, like treating ideas as something transitional, but not the final solutions, until the other members could articulate concerns.
*Groupthink can be responsible for collective decisions that are irrational, risky or even illegal. In a group setting in which cohesion and a positive social opinion of the group are highly valued, members put a lot of energy into ensuring harmony within the group.*

[Groupthink in UX Work](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/groupthink-in-ux/) by **Samhita Tankala**
A nice summary of symptoms of groupthink (collective rationalization, illusion of unanimity, self-censorship, and direct pressure on dissenters), with some guidelines to prevent it in UX activities. The guidelines are grouped by various scenarios (like during ideation or remote environments), which in itself also describes what are the common situation where groupthink can arise.
*Groups benefit from hearing diverse perspectives. For that to happen, group members have to feel comfortable in sharing their thoughts. We need to intentionally build awareness around groupthink, acknowledge that it occurs in group settings, and create a work environment that prevents it from happening.*

[Common-Knowledge Effect: A Harmful Bias in Team Decision Making](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/common-knowledge-effect/) by **Evan Sunwall**
While team decisions are generally better, the diversity of perspectives are often wasted, as team members are more comfortable discussing information they all already understand (the common-knowledge effect) and under utilize information only a few members know. One results of this phenomenon is groupthink. The article has a nice example scenario how this happens, what biases are in play, and what are some strategies to mitigate the effect.
*As counterintuitive as it seems, increasing the number of people involved in a difficult decision will likely decrease decision-making quality. Whatever unique knowledge individuals could offer to deliberations often goes unshared or disregarded.*
