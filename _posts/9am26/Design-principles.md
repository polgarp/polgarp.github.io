# ‚òï Design principles

Creating design principles is usually an attempt by the designer or the design team to create a reasonable foundation for articulating design choices. 

Why we want to have it - to have more consistent decision making over time and across team. Also for design to reach the intended goals, rather just reaching something. Making tradeoffs, but the tradeoffs we want to make. Also allows to execute on a design vision and strategy.

Specific to your product, so they need to be Research based. 

About how we build, about what we build, or team values? those are other type of principles. More about culture. Or for example I defined principles for hiring process, to have a good process, lowering bias and consistency of choices.

How are they making a difference? How do they prevent bad design being shipped and create [good design]({% post_url 2023-02-06-What-is-good-design %})? Too watered down to be of real benefit - who would say they don't want simple? They should be continuous part of discussions agreed and understood.

Apply - design briefs, design critiques. Highlight when articulate design decisions. They should inform or be the design rationale for decisions. Also, might need to understand how it applies to a given design project, interpret for the context, especially for larger and more complex products.

To create - start by defining locally (emergent), then merge into global - workshops, writing them, provide examples, give rationale (not just words on a poster), make sure to make it part of discussions, what do they mean? Also good practice to rank principles, when making tradeoffs, what should come first?

# üç™ Things to snack on

Liked this design principles use case from Gusto: **[How to Create Design Principles You‚Äôll Actually Use](https://modus.medium.com/how-to-create-design-principles-that-people-actually-use-11b534bf2425)** by **Jason Marder**. Describes a lot of nuance and the thinking that goes into such a process. Also has good examples on how to involve design team members - beyond brainstorming. I thought especially the idea of collecting existing examples for the MVP principles is a good way of establishing precedence. 

**Maria Rosala** writes about the general definition of design principles in **[Crafting Product-Specific Design Principles to Support Better Decision Making](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-principles/)**, and gives a simple framework to create your own. The steps are: 
1. Identify core values (for the product the team is working on, and may come from vision and mission).
2. Consider how these values impact users (to make sure design principles are user centered).
3. Identify any common tradeoffs (describe common conflicts that needs prioritization).
4. Write, compare and iterate.
She also gives some ideas how to make principles known in the wider organization.

While creating design principles might be tricky enough on it's own, deciding if they are great principles is another story. This is where **Jared Spool**'s **[Creating Great Design Principles: 6 Counter-intuitive Tests](https://articles.uie.com/creating-design-principles/)** helps. As the article writes, high level and overly aspirational design principles are not useful and effective, it's better to have more specific phrases. The six tests each describe an aspect the principles should fulfill. They are:
- Does it come directly from research?
- Does it help you say "no" most of the time?
- Does it distinguish your design from your competitors'?
- Is it something you might reverse in a future release?
- Have you evaluated it for this project?
- Is its meaning constantly tested?
Great design principles should get a yes to all of these.

**[What makes a good design principle?](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/principles/)** is an excellent article by **Matthew Str√∂m** that I found very helpful in formulating principles in the past - or more generally formulating any sort of decision guideline. He gives four criteria to evaluate design principles, they should be memorable, help saying no, be not truisms, and should be applicable. He also describes a simple shortcut to apply these criteria by using "Even Over" statements.

**Jerome de Lafargue** writes about how corporate design principles seem to converge in **[In the future, design principles won‚Äôt be about design](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-principles-c1f045b7aa26)**. As design principles become more general (like "Simple"), they don't apply anymore to a single product or to a portfolio of products, but to all possible products on the market, thus convergence is inevitable. So they are not much better than just using the principles of good design. The article also gives some points to what makes a good design principle (opinionated, applies to own context and establishes trade-offs). The conclusion about convergence is, that as good design is generally adopted in a given industry, design principles need to be focused more on users. 

**[Design Principles FTW](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/)** by **Meetod** is a vast collection of design principles (921 and counting). While adopting design principles from other organizations is not recommended - context differs after all, it's great to explore for inspiration. Most sets also have links that provide more context or describe how a given team defined their principles.
