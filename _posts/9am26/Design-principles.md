# ‚òï Design principles

Creating design principles is usually an attempt by the designer or the design team to create a reasonable foundation for articulating design choices. 

Research based. 

About how we build, about what we build, or team values?

How are they making a difference? How do they prevent bad design being shipped and create [good design]({% post_url 2023-02-06-What-is-good-design %})? Too watered down to be of real benefit - who would say they don't want simple? They should be continuous part of discussions agreed and understood.

Apply - design briefs, design critiques. Highlight when articulate design decisions. They should inform or be the design rationale for decisions. 

To create - start by defining locally (emergent), then merge into global, make sure to be part of discussions.

# üç™ Things to snack on

**[How to Create Design Principles You‚Äôll Actually Use](https://modus.medium.com/how-to-create-design-principles-that-people-actually-use-11b534bf2425)**

**[Crafting Product-Specific Design Principles to Support Better Decision Making](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-principles/)**

**[Creating Great Design Principles: 6 Counter-intuitive Tests](https://articles.uie.com/creating-design-principles/)**

**[What makes a good design principle?](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/principles/)** is an excellent article by **Matthew Str√∂m** that I found very helpful in formulating principles in the past - or more generally formulating any sort of decision guideline. He gives four criteria to evaluate design principles, they should be memorable, help saying no, be not truisms, and should be applicable. He also describes a simple shortcut to apply these criteria by using "Even Over" statements.

**Jerome de Lafargue** writes about how corporate design principles seem to converge in **[In the future, design principles won‚Äôt be about design](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-principles-c1f045b7aa26)**. As design principles become more general (like "Simple"), they don't apply anymore to a single product or to a portfolio of products, but to all possible products on the market, thus convergence is inevitable. So they are not much better than just using the principles of good design. The article also gives some points to what makes a good design principle (opinionated, applies to own context and establishes trade-offs). The conclusion about convergence is, that as good design is generally adopted in a given industry, design principles need to be focused more on users. 

**[Design Principles FTW](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/)** by **Meetod** is a vast collection of design principles (921 and counting). While adopting design principles from other organizations is not recommended - context differs after all, it's great to explore for inspiration. Most sets also have links that provide more context or describe how a given team defined their principles.
