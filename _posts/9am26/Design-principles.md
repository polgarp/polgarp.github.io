# ‚òï Design principles

Research based. 

About how we build, about what we build, or team values?

How are they making a difference? How do they prevent bad design being shipped and create [good design]({% post_url 2023-02-06-What-is-good-design %})? Too watered down to be of real benefit - who would say they don't want simple? They should be continuous part of discussions agreed and understood.

Apply - design briefs, design critiques. Highlight when articulate design decisions. They should inform or be the design rationale for decisions. 

To create - start by defining locally (emergent), then merge into global, make sure to be part of discussions.
