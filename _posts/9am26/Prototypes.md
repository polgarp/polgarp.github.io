Since we design interactive systems, prototypes are the most imost important artifacts we can produce in our work. This is independent of fidelitiy.

# ‚òï Fidelity levels in Prototypes

(With Invision closing doors I thought it's a good idea to look at prototyping, as it was one of the first tools that offered quick design-to-prototype capabilities for many of us, and the few years I've been using Invision solidified some of the ideas I'm focusing on in this episode.)

One problem with using tools that create static screens, is that the output is more likely to resemble a static screen, instead of the dynamic capabilities software enables us to do. 

Prototypes come in all sort of flavours, on a an abstract level, the current iteration prototypes the next iteration, it's a way to try out something, so we see what we will need to change later. So it's about learning. 

Also much of design is making abstract ideas concrete, rendering our ideas about the future more real. So closer to reality we get, more clearly we see the future.

Prototype is on of those fairly general words. Interactive mockups can be prototypes for the experience, as a Notion page can prototype a real product. Today I'll mostly focus on the prototypes designers create while rendering the intent and working towards something that can be delivered by engineers. In some contexts this means prototyping and even designing a UI can be avoided, as working in real code is more efficient.

Fidelitiy comes in many shapes, and generally it means how real the experience feels to the users. The most usual we encounter is visual (sketch vs finished UI) and interaction (static screens vs full interaction), but also copy, content (user's own data), and performance (speed and for AI apps accuracy) matters. So thinking about a singular fidelity scale is sometimes unhelpful.

# üç™ Things to snack on

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅÉ</p>

While **Todd Zaki Warfel**'s book,  [**Prototyping**](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/prototyping/) is dated for the tools introduced, it's still a great book for getting into prototyes, understand the overall and mindset and get some good tips. And to be honest, paper and Keynote are still good ways to get started with prototypes. 

While fidelity is often described as an attribute of prototypes, it's rarely useful if we want to use prototypes to test how an idea will perform. [**Prototype for a story-of-use, not fidelity**](https://uxplanet.org/prototype-for-a-story-of-use-not-fidelity-f931bf8ceab1#.qhx4g8cyk) by **George Abraham** explores this idea, and gives some nice arguments how focusing on experience instead of fidelity allows for more efficient prototyping.

Prototypes are a way to learn, as **Jared Spool** writes in [**# Exploring the Problem Space Through¬†Prototyping**](https://articles.centercentre.com/four_phases_prototyping/). This is a key difference between mockups (used to show a possible solution), as prototypes explore the problems in the design. This also shows how prototypes are useless if they are created, but not used for measuring, using the prototype as instrument to understand how the design performs. 

[**4 Powerful Ways to Use Rapid Prototyping to Drive Product Success**](https://www.producttalk.org/2018/01/rapid-prototyping/) is a nice short overview on how prototypes help the overall product design process by **Teresa Torres**. Besides the obvious usability testing, prototypes also help you think, answer questions, communicate, and make better decisions.

With Basecamp's sort of unique approach, it's interesting to see how interactive mocks fits into the process. In [**The Fidelity Curve: How to weigh the costs and benefits of creating UI mockups**](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/the-fidelity-curve-weighing-the-costs-and-benefits-of-interface-design-mockups-b259634807e2), **Ryan Singer** writes about the trade-off between getting more confidence and taking the time to build . If confidence gained from building a proto is similar to the time it takes to build (compared to create something in real code), it's better to go create in real code. This highlights the inherent challenge with prototypes too, the closer they simulate the real experience, the closer the effort is to just creating the real thing.
