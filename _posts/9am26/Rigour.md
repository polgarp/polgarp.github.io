# ‚òï Rigour

(Thanks for the topic idea and the insightful discussion, Louise!)

Talked too much about doing research at all, not talking enough what counts as good research. While it's better to talk to users vs don't talk to users, talking them the right wayis what actually makes it better, not jusr reinforcing biases and leading to sentences "We already knew this". How to evaluate process and output?

Even the most lean ux research has to have rigour.

So democratization should have rigor - the enabling people to do good research.

But the question arises do we need scientific rigour on our user research practice? We are (usually) don't make life and death choices. Well, that's true, but without rigour research will not be great, and it will get harder to argue for research, and ultimately the team might decide to not do research at all, or just collect some biased data.

Unfortunetally, this sometimes means bringing in the bad news - this is where storytelling skills, building relationships, creating trustworthiness comes in.


A sidenote - design also needs to have rigor. While ideas might be codified into processes or team rituals, in essence it's about declaring your intentions, articulate design decisions

Research rigor
**Credibility** ‚Äì The stringency of a study‚Äôs processes, accuracy of its sources, and level that findings that properly reflects its topic area
* **Applicability** ‚Äì The data‚Äôs and study processes‚Äô applicability to different contexts and scenarios ¬†
* **Consistency** ‚Äì The study‚Äôs findings degree of similarity if the research and its processes are repeated
* **Neutrality** ‚Äì Lack of biases, motives, or other elements that can skew findings

credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability.

UItimatley these are choices in the research process (or similarly in the design process).

Methods, tools or framework prmoising faster results should be viewed through these glasses, do we compromise on rigor or other aspects of the research?

This should also guide the introduction of both research methods and researcher role into orgs.

# üç™ Things to snack on

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅà</p>

[**Qualitative Rigor**](https://open.byu.edu/education_research/qualitative_rigor) is a fairly academic and long description of the topic from **David Dwayne Williams** & **Royce Kimmons**, nevertheless a good and comprehensive read. Qualitative research creates rigour by discipline of following standards and trustworthiness through credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability, this also provides a simple framework to check how well studies adhere to rigour.

While speed is important, it shouldn't stop researchers from doing quality research, as **Joe Munka** argues in [**Skip User Research Unless You‚Äôre Doing It Right ‚Äî Seriously**](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/skip-user-research-unless-youre-doing-it-right-seriously-15494e5ee033). 

**Janelle Ward** describes the internal (how precise is the research) and external (how credible are the results) aspects of rigour in [**Do we need rigor in UX research?**](https://dovetail.com/outlier/rigor-ux-research/). Embracing rigour means not to have an obstacle, but to be clear about the research process and build a reputation for quality work for the wider org to depend on.

In [**What does ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù research really mean?**](https://uxdesign.cc/what-does-rigorous-research-really-mean-977ad62bfd0b), **Chris Liu** makes an excellent point on rigour extending to how research insights are understood and used. A study is not finished once the report is delivered, if the points are used to underpin the opposite conclusion. Ignored study limitations (for example how many people actually answered a survey) also invalidate the rigour of the study. The article proposes three tactics: Err on the side of safety, Advocate not just for findings, but specific interpretations of findings, and Be open to being wrong.

**Adrienne Guillory** writes about how cutting corners in the research process leads to problems in [**The rigor of UX is in the research, not the design**](https://www.fastcompany.com/90792238/the-rigor-of-ux-is-in-the-research-not-the-design). The article also lists some tips how to strengthen the research process.

One reason it's important to talk about rigour is the state of the industry. I don't fully agree with **Cornelius Rachieru**'s [**‚ÄúEveryone Used to Be a Designer‚Äù**](https://uxplanet.org/everyone-used-to-be-a-designer-530aa762e415), but the point of how lowering our standards results in more problems rings true. Making the research & design process more open, accessible is collaborative is the right way to go, as becoming more agile. The rigour of our approach however should remain, and new tools need to be applied to strengthen rigour, rather than weakening it.
