# ☕ Rigour

(Thanks for the topic idea and the valuable feedback, Louise!)

Talked too much about doing research at all, not talking enough what counts as good research. While it's better to talk to users vs don't talk to users, talking them the right wayis what actually makes it better, not jusr reinforcing biases and leading to sentences "We already knew this". How to evaluate process and output?

Even the most lean ux research has to have rigour.

So democratization should have rigor - the enabling people to do good research.

Research rigor
**Credibility** – The stringency of a study’s processes, accuracy of its sources, and level that findings that properly reflects its topic area
* **Applicability** – The data’s and study processes’ applicability to different contexts and scenarios  
* **Consistency** – The study’s findings degree of similarity if the research and its processes are repeated
* **Neutrality** – Remove biases

UItimatley these are choices in the research process (or similarly in the design process).

Methods, tools or framework prmoising faster results should be viewed through these glasses, do we compromise on rigor or other aspects of the research?

This should also guide the introduction of both research methods and researcher role into orgs.

How to watch for signs of rigor when hiring researchers
