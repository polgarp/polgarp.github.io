# ‚òï Design value

Are we innovators? Creators of user value? Force multiplikators? 

A lot of design teams take their place for granted in their wider org. Since it's a common thing to have designers in a company (developing products), there doesn't need to be a deep reasoning why the team is there.

But if we don't have clarity on this, the team might get to an executional operator role, while some of the true value a design team could provide is created elsewhere. 

To put it bluntly, activites that are needed for creation of successful products will happen either way, the question is how much impact the right perspectives have on them, and if people with the right training are doing that.

Often I see UX and business are put at odds each other, but that's the wrong way to see - we must believe in good UX contributes to good business, it's at least adds to value, but more likely acts as a multiplicator.

Taking care of users. We must accept that long-term and sustainable business value is created through better serving users. This is not true for all businesses, companies might be set up for short term value.

Also many apps don't have designers but have design - why material got so popular for developers.

We can't expect others to tell us what the value we are bringing is - that's why they hired us, we should be talking about what we are bringing to the table.

So what's the value of designing.

# üç™ Things to snack on

To understand what value means for companies developing products, [**Understanding Value**](https://blackswanfarming.com/understanding-value/) by **Joshua Arnold** is a good introduction. There are four ways to think about value: increase revenue, protect revenue, reduce costs, avoid costs. The article also highlights the paradox of focusing on customer delight vs economics that many design teams might struggle with, and is a more general dilemma around in innovation.

**Matthew Godfrey** describes a complete framework on how to think about design's contribution in [**What‚Äôs the ROI of Design?**](https://medium.com/@MatthewGodfrey/whats-the-roi-of-design-70c26768f0c8). Design has both internal and external propositions to deliver values. Externally there are fit (how products fit customer jobs), function (product capabilities are desirable, usable and deliver value), and friction (product adoption, usage and satisfaction). Internally there are the discovery (de-risking assumptions to maximize the impact of engineering), decisions (rapidly evaluate impact of ideas), and delivery (reduce waste with better design-development workflows). The framework also shows how these propositions can be mapped to outcomes and measures via the Design Value Wheel.

A sign of value clarity is when hiring decisions are clear, everyone clearly understands how having more designers on board will impact the company. For early stage companies this might difficult to figure out, but **John Cutler**'s  [**Hire More Designers, OK?**](https://amplitude.com/blog/hire-more-designers) can help in this. It's a simple story of what happens if the number of engineers on the team grows, while the one designer in the team tries to keep up.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅé</p>

I liked **Zhaochang He**'s tale on value, as it provides a simple description of individual designers can connect to the broader business goals in [**As a designer, what business value do you bring to the table?**](https://uxdesign.cc/as-a-designer-what-business-value-do-you-bring-to-the-table-b544627e1972). Besides understanding the broader business goals, having clarity on product goals and metrics - and if they are missing helping the team figure those is key. A good perspective is also to think about how we work towards the business goals on behalf of the users.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅé</p>

[**Designers As Leaders: Now that we have a seat at the table, how do we prove we belong?**](https://douglaspowell1.medium.com/designers-as-leaders-now-that-we-have-a-seat-at-the-table-how-do-we-prove-we-belong-387f893adf28) is a nice case study by **Doug Powell**, from his time at IBM. It's focused on how leaders provide value to the organizations they work in by understanding the business and using their design skills (such as prototyping, system thinking, visualizing, facilitating, storytelling, or critiquing).
