# ☕ Desire paths

Likely met the concept before, since it has such a distinct vizualisation - people find their shortest way in a park, creating small paths, instead of the official paved roads. Smart builders pave over where people want to go. This is a useful analogy for UX design, though doesn't give the full picture.

(there is a subreddit for these path picutres https://www.reddit.com/r/DesirePaths/) 

Sometimes used as a metaphor for doing UX (assumed some research) and just doing UI design (assumed it's more artistic and egoistic thing)

How to use them

Notice what users do.
Figure out why they do it.
Design solutions
Repeat.

Great thing about these, that they provide instant upgrade to the existing ux. The bad thing that might serve more heavy users and confuse new users.



These appear as hacks, like a post it on the screen, own scripts etc. Maybe framing them as hacks turns down some stakeholders.
