How to fire up new hires.  
  
9 simple ways. What's the 10th?

💪 Ask them what they’re looking to gain from this role  
  
🌟 Small wins from the start, nothing fancy, but get moving  
  
🗺 Connect their role to the big picture - the “why this matters”  
  
📈 Show them the possible career growth options - the “how we help you”  
  
😎 A buddy with potential to become a workplace ride-or-die  
  
💡 Give them contact with senior leadership / founders early  
  
👋 Check in, a lot and regularly - so they know they’re heard
