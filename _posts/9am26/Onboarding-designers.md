**Christian Idiodi** writes about onboarding product people in [**New Employee Bootcamp**](https://svpg.com/new-employee-bootcamp/) as a core part of creating strong product teams. These bootcamps take 5 minutes to help new employees a few core questions: how decisions are made, company goals, building trust, and things to do next. The detailed topics also include talking about the customers, the vision, the financial context, building and prioritization, learning and measurements, these are covered by team members who understand the topic, and can share personal stories too.

A great and quite detailed article by **Will Larson** on engineering onboarding is [**Running your engineering onboarding program**](https://lethain.com/engineering-onboarding-programs/). It has a bunch of great tips that are also usable for design teams, on setting up the onboarding program, curriculum, what happens if things go wrong, and what should be the general aims for such a program.
