**Christian Idiodi** writes about onboarding product people in [**New Employee Bootcamp**](https://svpg.com/new-employee-bootcamp/) as a core part of creating strong product teams. These bootcamps take 5 minutes to help new employees a few core questions: how decisions are made, company goals, building trust, and things to do next. The detailed topics also include talking about the customers, the vision, the financial context, building and prioritization, learning and measurements, these are covered by team members who understand the topic, and can share personal stories too.

**Trello** has a bunch of good resources on onboarding, plus obviously board templates for planning in [**Your go-to employee onboarding checklist (and templates) for 2023**](https://blog.trello.com/employee-onboarding-checklist-and-templates). Most of these is what HR would set up as part of a broader onboarding, but I always liked to also set up bespoke checklists for designers and researchers.

As app onboarding helps users to get familiar with the software, so helps employee onboarding new people to get familiar with the organization, as **Rachel Krause** writes in [**Successful Onboarding for New Hires in UX Roles**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/onboarding-new-hires/).
