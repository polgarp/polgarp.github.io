# ‚òï Product trios for designers

Product trios are great. Each time I got to work in one I felt energized, while the work we did was more efficient and led to a better product besides being more satisfying to do. Also product trios can can be easily introduced with a simple venn diagram of three circles, and presenting a venn diagram always makes people look smarter üîó.

So why don't more organizations adopt them? 

Product trios are not exactly a new idea, at least working in cross-functional teams have been part of the agile movement for some time. 

Combining three core roles, typically product management, engineering, and design, these trios bring diverse perspectives, expertise, and insights to the table. This collaborative structure ensures a well-rounded approach to creating and enhancing products. Trios also seem like a successful organizational pattern for product development.

Rituals to do together. Process of work.

"Trio" in name, could be more people - successfully worked in teams where we had researcher and data - though dynamics change.

Two barriers for adoption seems the low amount of designers in some orgs and also the mindset shift the teams and leadership needs to do. Not focusing on the larger idea (Marty Cagan talks a lot about the advantages of empowered product teams), designers need to do two things:
 - involved earlier not being producers of UI only to get staffed up
 - understand the difference between being a ux designer and a product designer. not going into terminology, but, be a partner, have product thinking
 This is not easy, design leaders both need got strategy and have partnerships with other leaders to make it happen.

How to support designers in this setup

A lot of orgs however are not working like this, a few tips to get started.

Designers need seniority for this. Also: not great for junor designers

Tradeoff for design teams - being distributed lacks central direction, also defines org structure.



Also important - trios are always just a smaller part of a larger product teams (that might have additional engineers, QA, even other designers)


1.  Rituals and Processes for Trio Collaboration: For product trios to function effectively, establishing shared rituals and a defined process of work is crucial. These rituals can include regular stand-up meetings, design sprints, user research sessions, and collaborative decision-making processes. By fostering a cohesive working culture, product trios can streamline their efforts and drive efficient product development.
    
2.  Expanding the Concept of Trios: While the term "trio" typically implies three individuals, the actual composition of a product trio may vary. In some cases, additional roles such as researchers and data analysts can be integrated successfully. It's important to note that adding or modifying roles within the trio may impact the dynamics and require adjustments in communication and collaboration strategies.
    
3.  Supporting Designers within the Trio Setup: To ensure the success of product designers within a trio, organizations must provide an environment that supports their growth and effectiveness. Recognizing the importance of seniority is essential, as experienced designers can provide valuable insights and mentorship to junior team members. Additionally, investing in continuous learning opportunities and fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation will help designers thrive within the trio structure.
    
4.  Overcoming Challenges and Getting Started: While product trios offer numerous benefits, many organizations have yet to adopt this collaborative model. Here are a few tips to help organizations transition into product trios:
    

a. Start small and gradually expand: Begin by implementing the trio structure in a pilot project or a specific product area, allowing for experimentation and learning.

b. Foster cross-functional collaboration: Encourage open communication and collaboration among product management, engineering, and design, breaking down silos and promoting knowledge sharing.

c. Define clear roles and responsibilities: Establishing clear boundaries and expectations for each role within the trio helps avoid confusion and promotes accountability.

7.  Recognizing Trios within Larger Product Teams: While trios play a pivotal role in product development, it's important to acknowledge that they are just one part of larger product teams. Additional team members such as engineers, quality assurance professionals, and other designers may be part of the broader product development ecosystem. Understanding the interdependencies and dynamics within these larger teams is crucial for effective collaboration and successful product outcomes.

Conclusion: Product trios provide an effective framework for product development, leveraging the combined strengths of product management, engineering, and design. By supporting and empowering designers within these trios, organizations can unlock their full potential. While transitioning to a trio model may present challenges, the benefits of enhanced collaboration, streamlined processes, and efficient teamwork make it a worthwhile endeavor. By embracing the power of trios

# üç™ Things to snack on

While working in product trios is in many ways better for everyone involved, it's not for everyone. **Marty Cagan** writes about the required skill set each role needs for this in [**Product Core Competencies**](https://www.svpg.com/product-core-competencies/). Designers specifically should focus on the usability risk (which in this context means learnability, ease-of-use, and value perception) together with the overall experience of the product.

**Teresa Torres** writes often about product trios, besides her book **Continuous Discovery Habits** (which is a great resource on its own):
- [**The Product Trio**](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/05/product-trio/) describes the basics of cross-functional teams, how product trios work in practice.
- [**Collaborative Decision-Making in a Product Trio**](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/06/decision-making-in-a-product-trio/) highlights how sharing a common focus helps the trio - the designer, the engineer and the pm - to combine their unique perspective while they work together on projects. The article also describes a brief process for this, starting with an experience map, doing interviews together, developing a shared understanding.
- [**Why Product Trios Should Interview Customers Together**](https://www.producttalk.org/2020/03/interview-customers-together/) discusses why and how product trios should do their own research, rather than relying on outside teams. This allows them to get answers that is relevant for the product team right when they need it, while being immersed in the research process and engaged with users helps the team to internalize the insights.

[**The Product Trio: A 101**](https://www.end-game.com/blog/the-product-trio-a-101) is good overview by **Jezz Santos** for the responsibilities of the three roles, the trio approach for discovery, and how this approach differs from the more traditional views on product development.

Product trios also change how product leadership is done, making it a more collaborative process, as **Matthew Godfrey** writes in [**Product Trios: A collaborative, decision-making leadership group**](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/product-trios-a-collaborative-decision-making-leadership-group-91ea95453841). The article also has some nice practical tips, like how the roles' focus changes over the development process.
