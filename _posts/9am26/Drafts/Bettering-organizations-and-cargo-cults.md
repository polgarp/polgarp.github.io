bettering organisations
People like to get better, and they have a better image of themselves in their head - for example we buy books we think we should read, or we apsire to read, only to leave them on the bookshelf without ever opening. Or the thing with netflix, we tend to put documentaries on our wishlist, and end up with watching the next simple comedy. Organizations (and even society) are similar, they buy ideas for their better self in the quest of ever getting better. Sometimes thoser ideas are more like promotions for expensive consultant services, and other times they are powerfull forces present around the organization. Like agilen - even with forward thinking organizations it doesnt happen at times, but we believe it's something we want, something we can be better with, so we buy it and tryo to make it work.
