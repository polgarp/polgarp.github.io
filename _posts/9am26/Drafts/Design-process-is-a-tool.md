# ☕ Design process is a tool

Is it for alignment? Communicating what the team does? Guidance for more junior designers? A way to scale the design team? Promoting better design practices? 

Juniors need to learn what to do. Seniors need to know when to break.

Process is multifaceted, tries to capture tasks, collaboration, timelines, planning.


One way processes fail, focusing on unit of work as project, rather than product. Projects have a definite end and beginning and kinda align with day-to-day work, but when working with products, research is continuous and also small improvements can be continuous. process is not a standalone thing.
