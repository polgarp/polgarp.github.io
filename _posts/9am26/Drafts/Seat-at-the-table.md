# ‚òï Seat at the table - what to do once you are sitting at the table

###

**Getting a seat at the table** has been the holy grail for design teams for a long time. The general expectation is that once the designers are at the table, they would have a bigger say in what gets built. But what happens when a design leader actually has that seat - what are the concrete things they would need to talk about?

Seat at the table means different things in various levels. On a product team level it means.. On an organisation level it means... on a company level it means.

The key thing is that once you sit at the table, your first team shifts from the design team to the leadership team. Meaning you need to both apply your design skills, and possibly learn new skills and understand the common terminology to work with the rest of the leadership group. You are not just a messenger between "management" and the design team, but need to actively contribute to whatever the leadership group is doing.

Designers have unique skills and perspective that allows them for unique contribution:

- Owning the innovation proceess
- Brining user research results, qualitative and possibly quantiative stories.
- Draw models, frameworks, visualisations of work
- Bring input for design aspects of projects, plans
- Set design and user centricity up for success
- Think about ways how design affects other organisations. Think about how design is affected by other organisations.

The above needs to adopted to the type of discussions happening within the leadership group.

A nice case study how building towards and executing strategic projects can put design in the driver seat.

Gives a pretty good explanation what to do at the seat (besides the work product requires): advocate: fight for your team, say no, evangelize, cheer, champion, be relentless.
