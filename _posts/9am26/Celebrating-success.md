# ‚òï Celebrating successes

One of the most frequent issues I've seen teams raise is to celebrate successes more. This goes both for large things (like new product launches) and also for small things (like crushing a week's tasks). A lot of teams seem to be struggling with establishing the rituals to acknowledge wins, which also seems to be holding back the team from growing.

When I started leading teams many years ago, one of my first reports told me that if I want to lead a team and not just some designers, we would need rituals, especially around celebrating. So I did the most simple thing I could think of - I started to regularly bring cakes and have events with the team where we took a bit of time during the day to hang out. This worked well, but also we never went beyond and upgraded this ritual.

For a lot people and a lot of teams, celebrating seems to be hard. People focus on the next goals and don't have time to look back. Sometimes the bar for success is set so high that anything below astounding success is not worth celebrating, small wins and successes are not worth mentioning. People might feel there is not time to hang out, as there is a stream of tasks waiting. And also some teams have developed a culture that keeps from acknowledging wins.

In fast-paced product orgs all these issues hit even harder. Project are seemingly never done, big launches are overshadowed by iterative development and staged rollouts. Phases are not done, but continued later. Teams are always after the next experiment, feature or customer need to take care of.

When there is no celebration, motivation and engagement declines. Achievements get unnoticed, people don't grow as much as they have the potential to, there is a lack of reflection and learning. Morale sinks and overall job satisfactions declines. Team members might experience burnout and stress. So recognizing and celebrating achievements is crucial for fostering a positive work environment, boosting team morale, and maintaining a motivated and engaged team.

On the plus side, if the team celebrates, there is a better motivation and engagement, morale and the team cohesion improves (which is especially important for distributed design teams), there is more space for learning and improvement, and team members get more confidence in their own abilities and value.

When it comes to establishing a culture that celebrates, team leaders have. crucial role. They are leading by example - actively acknowledging wins and creating a positive tone and routine for celebrations, but their role goes beyond that. Leaders also need to foster a supportive environment where sharing and especially sharing success is encouraged. This includes to more broadly sharing success stories from the team. Team cultures celebrate more if it not only comes from the top, but also peers recognize wins.

How to do celebration?



But it's also difficult, as each team is different, and team members might have conflicting needs. Going out for drinks late? Would be better to go home early and play with kids. Taking the time

Most important - has to be authentic. Remember all the awkward remote team meeting when corona started? For the most teams it wasn't authentic, since they didn't had time to figure out how they do this online. The laid back Friday afternoon beers don't translate well to the online space.


How to get people to contribute?

This is where also adding to the team culture is important. Leaders need to contribute to the team culture. But also more senior team members would be expected.

# üç™ Things to snack on

[**The Power of Small Wins**](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins) by **Teresa M. Amabile** and **Steven J. Kramer** is a deep dive into the progress principle, how it affects motivation and mood in general, and also how it contributes having a great day at work. Part of progress are meaning, catalyst (work supporting activities) and nourishers (interpersonal support) which help to shift people's perception of work and themselves. If there are celebrations, they should act as nourishers but still connect to meaning and catalysts.

I liked the core idea of [**Micro-wins: celebrating progress over success**](https://nesslabs.com/micro-wins) by **Anne-Laure Le Cunff**, to not only focus on the large wins, but also on the daily small victories. This helps to keep a sense progress - which is a good predictor of having a good day. These micro-wins can be anything, like crossing out a task item (one reason why it makes sense to break up all large tasks to at least 10 smaller steps). The real power for micro-wins comes through celebration - which creates further positive feedback loops.

While more about celebrating personal wins, the same ideas from **Kim Witten**'s' [**7 meaningful ways to celebrate success**](https://medium.com/@KimWitten/7-meaningful-ways-to-celebrate-success-de57c72a5687) can be applied in teams. These seven ways can also act as guidelines when setting up rituals (like publicizing, thanking and sharing).

**Lucy Bishop** has a few tips for remote workers in [**Your Working From Home Celebration Tips**](https://www.mindtools.com/blog/celebrating-success-virtual-team-top-tips/). Having a kudos channel, celebrate on end-of-week get-togethers or getting random gifts might sound cheesy if they are forced, but are some of the obvious choices to give and get praise. 

**David Villa** lists several reasons on why teams should celebrate in [**How Celebrating Success Can Lead To More Of It**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2022/05/12/how-celebrating-success-can-lead-to-more-of-it/). It boosts morale, it can lessen ininterpersonal conflicts, can lead to more successes, impacts the bottom line. But maybe the most important advice the article gives on how to celebrate is to find out what works for your team.
