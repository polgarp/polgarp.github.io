# ‚òï Celebrating successes

One of the most frequent issues I've seen teams raise as something to start doing is to celebrate successes more.

Why? It seems partly celebrating is hard. The pace of product development orgs is fast, and projects are seemingly never done, big launches are overshadowed by iterative development and staged rollouts. Phases are not done, but continued later. Also people tend to be more maximalists, focusing on minor wins is not good enough 

It would be easy to guess what ha s been the most commonly raised issue by the teams I've lead over the years. We need to celebrate our successes more. It seems it's one of those highly desirable things that takes time figure out with each teams and that is wildly different with each team. Or, as one of my first reports told me at years ago - if I want to lead a team and not just some designers, we would need rituals. 

Obviously, celebrating successes is great. The team did well, it should be acknowledged. It builds team morale, strengthens 

But it's also difficult, as each team is different, and team members might have conflicting needs. Going out for drinks late? Woould be better to go home early and play with kids. Taking the time


Most important - has to be authentic. Remember all the awkward remote team meeting when corona started? For the most teams it wasn't authentic, since they didn't had time to figure out how they do this online. The laid back Friday afternoon beers don't translate well to the online space.

This is where also adding to the team culture is important. Leaders need to contribute to the team culture. But also more senior team members would be expected. 


Wrote in the past about how individuals should keep track of their wins with a brag doc, but this practice is also crucial on a team level - builds team culture and fosters a positive environment.


1.  Boosting Morale and Motivation: Recognizing and celebrating successes uplifts the morale of design team members. It acknowledges their hard work, creativity, and achievements, motivating them to continue performing at their best. This positive reinforcement helps create a supportive and inspiring work environment.
    
2.  Fostering a Positive Culture: Celebrating successes cultivates a culture of appreciation and positivity within the design team. When team members witness their colleagues being recognized and celebrated, it creates a sense of camaraderie and encourages collaboration, cooperation, and healthy competition. It also helps build a culture that values and rewards excellence.
    
3.  Encouraging Innovation and Risk-Taking: Celebrating successes reinforces the idea that taking risks and pushing boundaries is encouraged and rewarded. Design is an iterative process where experimentation and learning from failures are essential. By celebrating successful design outcomes, team members are more likely to take calculated risks, explore creative solutions, and embrace innovation.
    
4.  Enhancing Team Cohesion: Celebrating successes brings the design team closer together. It provides opportunities for team members to come together, share their achievements, and appreciate each other's contributions. This sense of unity and shared accomplishment strengthens the bonds within the team, fostering a collaborative and supportive work environment.
    
5.  Recognizing and Retaining Talent: Celebrating successes is a powerful tool for recognizing the talent and expertise of individual team members. It not only acknowledges their skills but also highlights their value to the organization. Recognizing and celebrating successes can increase job satisfaction and employee engagement, contributing to higher retention rates and attracting top talent to join the design team.
    
6.  Improving Client and Stakeholder Relationships: Celebrating successes can extend beyond the design team and positively impact client and stakeholder relationships. Sharing successful design outcomes with clients and stakeholders demonstrates the team's capabilities and builds trust and confidence in their work. It can lead to stronger client relationships, repeat business, and referrals.


On the side: celebrating successes is also an important design principle, when the user finishes something successfully, we should give them a clear feedback, to make them positive feels.

# üç™ Things to snack on

[**The Power of Small Wins**](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins) by **Teresa M. Amabile** and **Steven J. Kramer** is a deep dive into the progress principle, how it affects motivation and mood in general, and also how it contributes having a great day at work. Part of progress are meaning, catalyst (work supporting activities) and nourishers (interpersonal support) which help to shift people's perception of work and themselves. If there are celebrations, they should act as nourishers but still connect to meaning and catalysts.

I liked the core idea of [**Micro-wins: celebrating progress over success**](https://nesslabs.com/micro-wins) by **Anne-Laure Le Cunff**, to not only focus on the large wins, but also on the daily small victories. This helps to keep a sense progress - which is a good predictor of having a good day. These micro-wins can be anything, like crossing out a task item (one reason why it makes sense to break up all large tasks to at least 10 smaller steps). The real power for micro-wins comes through celebration - which creates further positive feedback loops.

While more about celebrating personal wins, the same ideas from **Kim Witten**'s' [**7 meaningful ways to celebrate success**](https://medium.com/@KimWitten/7-meaningful-ways-to-celebrate-success-de57c72a5687) can be applied in teams. These seven ways can also act as guidelines when setting up rituals (like publicizing, thanking and sharing).

**Lucy Bishop** has a few tips for remote workers in [**Your Working From Home Celebration Tips**](https://www.mindtools.com/blog/celebrating-success-virtual-team-top-tips/). Having a kudos channel, celebrate on end-of-week get-togethers or getting random gifts might sound cheesy if they are forced, but are some of the obvious choices to give and get praise. 

**David Villa** lists several reasons on why teams should celebrate in [**How Celebrating Success Can Lead To More Of It**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2022/05/12/how-celebrating-success-can-lead-to-more-of-it/). It boosts morale, it can lessen ininterpersonal conflicts, can lead to more successes, impacts the bottom line. But maybe the most important advice the article gives on how to celebrate is to find out what works for your team.
