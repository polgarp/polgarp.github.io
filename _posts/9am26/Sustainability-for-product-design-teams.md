# ‚òï Sustainability for product design teams

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges are facing, and it's also a piece in a set of interconnected problems we will need to solve in the next few years. In the past, I've always had the assumption that by working on tech products I'd in some ways contribute to these solutions (at least as long as I don't work on software for oil companies). Now, with climate change seemingly getting worse, I have to admit, this assumption has been naive at best. As a product designer I'd want to be more proactive in adding sustainable practices not only to my life but also to how I design.

> **Note from Peter** Compared to other topics I cover in this newsletter, I don't have that much experience working with sustainable techniques. Researching and writing this issue is part of how I intend to learn and apply these more often.

The first step towards more sustainable product design is to better understand the impact of our practices. I've added some resources on this, but product design can have a positive impact on two ways, on a tactical and on a strategic level.

On the tactical level the design should take into consideration the carbon consumption of apps and websites. In general this means less consumption of data and computation and more usable interfaces (which turns to less time wasted by users). Performance and better UX is usually an easy sell, but less time spent on the website and (artificial) engagement might lead to difficult discussions with the business.

On the more strategic level product design through deep understanding of users and creative problem-solving can influence business models for services and what features are added to products, in some cases also what products are created. Depending on the product category the impact can be larger here than on the tactical level.

The difficulty in having more sustainable practices is part just plain old inertia. When we try to adopt new practices and mindsets (whether it's new ethical standards, accessibility, increased [design quality]({% post_url 2023-02-06-What-is-good-design})), the push of work that needs to happen often leaves little time to adopt. One way to counteract is to embed such practices directly into the design process: revising [design principles]({% post_url 2023-02-12-Design-principles-set-the-foundation-for-good-design}) to include a sustainability angle, adding such principles to [design intentions]({% post_url 2023-02-20-Design-intent-describes-what-the-we-set-out-to-achieve}), and having sustainability checks as part of the definition of done. 

This might include adoption of new methods

Obviously the above won't have an impact, if it doesn't go beyond the immediate designer. On a team level this would include fostering a culture - for example having talks

Beyond the design team



2.  Foster a Culture of Sustainability: Advocate for a culture of sustainability within your design team. This includes raising awareness about sustainability issues, promoting responsible consumption and production, and encouraging team members to take ownership of their impact on the environment. Consider incorporating sustainability as a core value in your team's mission and vision, and celebrate sustainability-driven achievements.
    
3.  Collaborate with Cross-functional Teams: Promote collaboration with other teams, such as engineering, product management, and marketing, to collectively work towards sustainable product design goals. Foster open communication channels for discussing sustainability considerations, sharing best practices, and aligning strategies. Cross-functional collaboration can lead to more holistic and impactful sustainability initiatives throughout the entire product development lifecycle.
    
4.  Educate and Empower Designers: Provide training and resources to your designers on sustainable design practices. Educate them on the environmental impact of design decisions, such as the use of certain materials or the energy consumption of different design elements. Encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills to empower designers to make sustainable choices. Provide access to tools, guidelines, and resources that support sustainable design practices.
    
5.  Measure and Report Sustainability Metrics: Establish a framework to measure and report sustainability metrics for your digital products. This may include tracking the carbon footprint, energy consumption, or waste generation of your products. Set sustainability goals and regularly monitor progress towards those goals. Share the results with your team and stakeholders to raise awareness and foster accountability for sustainability efforts.

# üç™ Things to snack on

Some resources to get started:
- [**www.climatedesigners.org**](https://www.climatedesigners.org/) - A network for "climate designers", has connecting events, learning resources and a job board.
- [**Sustainable Web Design**](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/) - Method ("strategies") listing for sustainable web, emission calculation and links to further resources.
- [**the-sustainable.dev**](https://the-sustainable.dev/) - More focused on developers, useful when designing for the web.
- [**The Sustainable UX Network**](https://sustainableuxnetwork.com/) - A design community with a Slack group and a podcast to learn more on sustainability.
- [**lowwwcarbon**](https://lowwwcarbon.com/) - A showcase of low-carbon websites.

While sustainability may start with thinking about the direct consumption of the product we create, there is more to that according to **Sandy D√§hnert** in [**Sustainable UX is more than reducing your website‚Äòs footprint**](https://uxdesign.cc/sustainable-ux-and-ui-design-is-more-than-reducing-your-website-s-footprint-a99c336c151f). The article breaks down sustainability to UX research, UX architecture, UI design, and communications and gives various tools to address sustainability. 

Product design is exactly impact driven, as the aims are commercial, as **Csilla Narai** writes in [**Impact-driven design: getting the results you want**](https://uxdesign.cc/impact-driven-design-getting-the-results-you-want-392fabb095c8). But impact mindset helps in design work in a variety of ways: strategic focus, more effectively tackle complexity, improves brand resilience. The article presents a few tools to achieve this, Theory of Change, Change Roadmap, Leadership - these can be embedded into a product design process.

There are a bunch of great ideas in [**Product Design for Sustainability**](https://uxdesign.cc/product-design-for-sustainability-3fffbb2a7f0e) by **Artiom Dashinsky** on how to add simple features to products that result in more sustainable outcomes. Also, some of the ideas came true since the article was written showing that change for the better is possible. While figuring out similar ideas in any product might be not trivial, as the article shows it might lead also to better business outcomes.

Product design's challenges to include sustainability goes beyond simple tactics, unfortunately there are systematic barriers. **Sanna Rau** mentions two of these in [**What stops us from designing a sustainable future?**](https://uxdesign.cc/what-stops-us-from-designing-a-sustainable-future-1f354143bc8b), reductionism and measurements of success. Reductionism states that complex problems can be broken down to simple problems to be solved, which for example results product teams and designers working on separate pieces of the experience - resulting in silos. This keeps designers from taking a more holistic approach. Measurements of success on the other hand steers the outcomes the teams trying to achieve, and since they focus on piece of the larger word, that may hide parts of the entire truth. These two together result in having no simple, easy to use solution to a complex problem as sustainability.

**Daniel Christian Wahl**'s article, [**Designing sustainable business models and product service systems**](https://medium.com/activate-the-future/designing-sustainable-business-models-and-product-service-systems-cd548328e852) takes the system design's view by showing a few types of business model canvases that includes sustainability. Product design usually works on lower levels than a business model, but these provide a good inspiration how to systematically include sustainability into artifacts the design team is creating.
