# ‚òï Sustainability for product design teams

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges are facing, and even more so it's just a part of a set of interconnected problems we will need to solve in the next few years. In the past, I've always had the assumption that by working on tech products I'd in some ways to contribute to the solutions (at least as long as I don't work on software for oil companies). Now, with climate change seemingly getting worse, it seems this assumption has been naive at best. As a product designer I'll need to be more proactive in adding sustainable practices not only my life but also to my work.

> **Note from Peter** Compared to other topics I cover in this newsletter, I don't have that much experience working with sustainable techniques. Researching and writing this issue is part of how I intend to learn and apply these more often.

Set of interconnected problems. In the past I had the assumption that if I worked. Now this is not neccessaryily true, and ast the urgency of climate change increases, more explicit methods are needed.

1.  Incorporate Sustainable Design Principles: Emphasize the importance of integrating sustainable design principles into the product design process. This includes considering the environmental impact of materials, energy usage, and end-of-life disposal of products. Encourage your team to explore design solutions that are resource-efficient, minimize waste, and promote circular economy concepts such as recycling and upcycling.
    
2.  Foster a Culture of Sustainability: Advocate for a culture of sustainability within your design team. This includes raising awareness about sustainability issues, promoting responsible consumption and production, and encouraging team members to take ownership of their impact on the environment. Consider incorporating sustainability as a core value in your team's mission and vision, and celebrate sustainability-driven achievements.
    
3.  Collaborate with Cross-functional Teams: Promote collaboration with other teams, such as engineering, product management, and marketing, to collectively work towards sustainable product design goals. Foster open communication channels for discussing sustainability considerations, sharing best practices, and aligning strategies. Cross-functional collaboration can lead to more holistic and impactful sustainability initiatives throughout the entire product development lifecycle.
    
4.  Educate and Empower Designers: Provide training and resources to your designers on sustainable design practices. Educate them on the environmental impact of design decisions, such as the use of certain materials or the energy consumption of different design elements. Encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills to empower designers to make sustainable choices. Provide access to tools, guidelines, and resources that support sustainable design practices.
    
5.  Measure and Report Sustainability Metrics: Establish a framework to measure and report sustainability metrics for your digital products. This may include tracking the carbon footprint, energy consumption, or waste generation of your products. Set sustainability goals and regularly monitor progress towards those goals. Share the results with your team and stakeholders to raise awareness and foster accountability for sustainability efforts.

[**Sustainable UX is more than reducing your website‚Äòs footprint**](https://uxdesign.cc/sustainable-ux-and-ui-design-is-more-than-reducing-your-website-s-footprint-a99c336c151f) by **Sandy D√§hnert**

There are a bunch of great ideas in [**Product Design for Sustainability**](https://uxdesign.cc/product-design-for-sustainability-3fffbb2a7f0e) by **Artiom Dashinsky** on how to add simple features to products that result in more sustainable outcomes. Also, some of the ideas came true since the article was written showing that change for the better is possible. While figuring out similar ideas in any product might be not trivial, as the article shows it might lead also to better business outcomes.

Product design's challenges to include sustainability goes beyond simple tactics, unfortunately there are systematic barriers. **Sanna Rau** mentions two of these in [**What stops us from designing a sustainable future?**](https://uxdesign.cc/what-stops-us-from-designing-a-sustainable-future-1f354143bc8b), reductionism and measurements of success. Reductionism states that complex problems can be broken down to simple problems to be solved, which for example results product teams and designers working on separate pieces of the experience - resulting in silos. This keeps designers from taking a more holistic approach. Measurements of success on the other hand steers the outcomes the teams trying to achieve, and since they focus on piece of the larger word, they may hide parts of the entire truth. These two together result in having no simple, easy to use solution to a complex problem as sustainability.

**Daniel Christian Wahl**'s article, [**Designing sustainable business models and product service systems**](https://medium.com/activate-the-future/designing-sustainable-business-models-and-product-service-systems-cd548328e852) takes the system design's view by showing a few types of business model canvases that includes sustainability. Product design usually works on lower levels than a business model, but these provide a good inspiration how to systematically include sustainability into artifacts the design team is creating.
