# ‚òï Asking great user interview questions
What's the key question to decide? 
One of the most basic and widespread methods, still some of it hard to get right. Especially right questions at the right time.

With AI methods to write our guides and possibly conduct the interviews, more important to understand nuance of askign questions and be humans.

Not your research questions. 

Typically anybody can do user interview, but that's jsut to say that anyone can start without a heavy training, great results still assume practice.

Great interview is more like a discussion than an interrogation. 

Avoid bias by. 

Establish space by asking a few easy questions.

Rhythm, feedback.


What we did a lot of iterations on each guide to get to better questions.

Guide to not guide, what's helpful for questions.

1.  Start with open-ended questions: Begin your interview with open-ended questions that allow the user to express their thoughts and feelings freely. For example, "Can you tell me about your experience with \[product/service\]?" or "What are some challenges you've faced in \[activity\]?"
    
2.  Use follow-up questions: Once the user has answered your initial question, ask follow-up questions to dig deeper into their response. For example, "Can you tell me more about \[specific point the user mentioned\]?" or "How did you feel when \[specific event\] happened?"
    
3.  Ask about specific examples: To get a better understanding of the user's experience, ask about specific examples of when they've used the product or service, or encountered a particular problem. For example, "Can you walk me through a recent experience you had with \[product/service\]?" or "Can you give me an example of a time when \[specific problem\] occurred?"
    
4.  Use hypothetical questions: Sometimes it can be useful to ask hypothetical questions to get the user's perspective on a future scenario. For example, "If \[feature\] were added to the product, how would you use it?" or "What would you do if \[specific problem\] occurred again?"
    
5.  Avoid leading questions: Be careful not to ask questions that steer the user towards a particular answer. For example, instead of asking "Don't you think \[feature\] is great?", ask "What are your thoughts on \[feature\]?"
    
6.  Consider the user's perspective: Put yourself in the user's shoes and ask questions from their perspective. For example, "How would you like to see \[product/service\] improve?" or "What would make your experience with \[product/service\] better?"

# üç™ Things to snack on

The best resource on user interviews in general is the **[Interviewing Users](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/)** book by **Steve Portigal**. It has a chapter that goes into great detail about asking great questions. Also some great tips what to do between questions with topics like managing the flow of the interview, how to deal with silence, what type of questions to ask, and how to work with the user's view (as opposed to the interviewer's).

**[User Interviews: How, When, and Why to Conduct Them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/)** is a more extensive guide on the user interview practice by **Kara Pernice** with some great tips on constructing questions.

When constructing the questions for the interview, a great way to structure them is the funnel technique. **Maria Rosala** and **Kate Moran** write about this in **[The Funnel Technique in Qualitative User Research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-funnel-technique-in-qualitative-user-research/)**. On a very high level this means to start from broad and open-ended questions and drill down to details with narrowing followup questions up until closed questions to get clear details. 

Jobs to be Done interviews are a specific flavor of user interviews that is targeted to understand the reasons for users switching to and using a particular service or product, as **Nikki Anderson-Stanier** writes in **[The Jobs to be Done Interviewing Style: Who are our Users Trying to Become?](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/the-jobs-to-be-done-interviewing-style-understanding-who-users-are-trying-to-become)**. While similar to regular user interviews, there are specific questions to learn about the switching behavior, and the article lists a bunch of great examples. 

We shouldn't loose sight, that every research activity should focus on what outcome it's supporting. **Teresa Torres** gives some idea what questions to ask for a specific opportunity with story based interviews in **[What Are the Best Customer Interview Questions?](https://www.producttalk.org/2022/04/best-customer-interview-questions/)**. Depending on the opportunity, the focus of the questions should be on different part of the stories shared by the users. 

Followup questions are how the researcher makes the interview flow like a conversation, as **Taylor Nguyen** writes in **[A beginner‚Äôs guide to asking follow-up questions in user interviews](https://uxdesign.cc/a-beginners-guide-to-asking-follow-up-questions-in-user-interviews-2fbeba124712)**. Follow up questions can zoom in on the details or zoom out to focus on the context, with a third category of situational questions. The article list question types and examples for each. Also there are some good tips how to manage the list of followup questions by taking notes - not on what the user is saying, but what needs to be asked still. 

**[Dig Deeper on 1-1 Interviews with Insightful Follow-Up Questions](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/generative-research-questions)** is another great article on followup questions by **Nikki Anderson-Stanier**. There are some great tips here that help with figuring out how to ask great followup questions (Develop a sense of curiosity, Use active listening, Embrace silence, Probe subjective or vague words and phrases) plus some concrete phrases a researcher can use to construct followup questions.

Depending on the research questions, asking "Why?" can be a helpful way to drill down and understand deeper reasons. Sometimes asking Why directly leads to false reasoning from the participants. **Tia Loehnert** wrote about asking why question alternatives in a non-research context in **[15 Ways To Ask Why Without Asking Why](https://productcoalition.com/15-ways-to-ask-why-without-asking-why-3a8e067832fa)**, these can be used in a user interviews too.

Leading questions are the bane of user interviews, one that leads to bias and false insights and ultimately to a failed research. **Amy Schade** has some tips on how to steer clear of these in **[Avoid Leading Questions to Get Better Insights from Participants](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/leading-questions/)**.

**Slava Shestopalov** describes some of the ways questions can go wrong in **[12 Ways To Improve User Interview Questions](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/user-interview-questions/)**. Some pitfalls are related to well-known issues (like leading questions, hypothetical questions or closed questions), but there are a few more interesting ones. Selfish questions focus on the relation between the interviewer and the product idea, rather than the user and the product idea. Stacked questions combine multiple questions into one. Some other nice tips on how to avoid vagueness, too general answers, and ambiguous amounts.
