# ‚òï Asking great user interview questions
What's the key question to decide? 
One of the most basic and widespread methods, still some of it hard to get right. Especially right questions at the right time.

With AI methods to write our guides and possibly conduct the interviews, more important to understand nuance of askign questions and be humans.

Not your research questions. 

Typically anybody can do user interview, but that's jsut to say that anyone can start without a heavy training, great results still assume practice.

Great interview is more like a discussion than an interrogation. 

Avoid bias by. 

Establish space by asking a few easy questions.

Rhythm, feedback.

Guide to not guide, what's helpful for questions.

1.  Start with open-ended questions: Begin your interview with open-ended questions that allow the user to express their thoughts and feelings freely. For example, "Can you tell me about your experience with \[product/service\]?" or "What are some challenges you've faced in \[activity\]?"
    
2.  Use follow-up questions: Once the user has answered your initial question, ask follow-up questions to dig deeper into their response. For example, "Can you tell me more about \[specific point the user mentioned\]?" or "How did you feel when \[specific event\] happened?"
    
3.  Ask about specific examples: To get a better understanding of the user's experience, ask about specific examples of when they've used the product or service, or encountered a particular problem. For example, "Can you walk me through a recent experience you had with \[product/service\]?" or "Can you give me an example of a time when \[specific problem\] occurred?"
    
4.  Use hypothetical questions: Sometimes it can be useful to ask hypothetical questions to get the user's perspective on a future scenario. For example, "If \[feature\] were added to the product, how would you use it?" or "What would you do if \[specific problem\] occurred again?"
    
5.  Avoid leading questions: Be careful not to ask questions that steer the user towards a particular answer. For example, instead of asking "Don't you think \[feature\] is great?", ask "What are your thoughts on \[feature\]?"
    
6.  Consider the user's perspective: Put yourself in the user's shoes and ask questions from their perspective. For example, "How would you like to see \[product/service\] improve?" or "What would make your experience with \[product/service\] better?"
