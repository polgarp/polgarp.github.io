# ‚òï T-shaped design teams

Product team are at the core of modern product development, and their structure is mostly established. Each one should have a product manager, engineers and a product designer. As the product team does discovery, the PM, the designer and an engineer collaborate as a product trio. Sometimes there are other experts joining, but this product trio within a product team setup proved to be an effective way of creating products.

Product design teams are set up in a distributed fashion to accommodate the product team team strucutre, having one product designer in each. As part of a product team, a product designer will do all kinds of design things. For example: user research, facilitating workshops, creating concepts, iteratively designing solutions, usability testing and UI design. Sometimes also doing other things depending on the team and the product's needs, like service design, UX writing, illustrations, marketing materials - whatever an end-to-end product development process needs. 

For all these different activities, the designer needs to have proficiency in multiple disciplines. To get high quality design, this means being exceptional in both knowledgable and experienced each of these skills. It's now wonder such designers are called unicorns, as having a high level of skills in all these fields is rare. 

Hiring a team of unicorns is next to impossible. A better approach is to hire people who are good generalist, and to make sure that the whole team possesses deep knowledge for all relevant disciplines. The product team can progress with the generalist designer on board, who can reach out to the broader product team if deeper expertise is needed.

This type of generalist desingers are called T-shaped. The top (horizontal) arm of the T represents the generalist knowledge - what's needed for most projects in a product team throughout the process of research, discovery, delivery, go to market. Everyone from the design team needs to be able to do the general activites on a reasonable level. The T's (vertical) stem represents an individual's specialization, may it be research, prototyping, storytelling or anything that comes from past experience or personal interest. The specialization not only helps in the designer's own projects, but also levels up the whole team.

The T-shaped desingers come together to collaborate when there is a project in an other product team, where their specialization makes the work more efficient or of higher quality. This is a how a design team composed of T-shaped designers can be more impactful.

This idea also guides hiring - as we look for new team members, we also need to find somebody who not only fits into their respective product team, but also adds another T to the design team, enhancing what the team is capable of.

The T-shape also applies to the more specialist members of the team. If there is a research team, it's better to have one person more experienced in qualitative and an other more experienced in mixed-methods or quantitative methods than to have 2 persons with the exact same skillset.

# üç™ Things to snack on

**[The Generalized Specialist: How Shakespeare, Da Vinci, and Kepler Excelled](https://fs.blog/generalized-specialist/)** by Farnam Street is a good primer on the differences between generalists and specialists. Generalists are a sort of jack of all trades, while a specialist is a master of a single area. As the article describes while they are the opposite, it's actually a spectrum with people excelling in the middle by building a specialization on a generalist knowledge.

Our craft changes a lot with both the changing expectations towards to role of designers and the changing technological landscape. Eva Schicker's **[The amazing T-shaped UX designer](https://evaschicker2012.medium.com/the-amazing-t-shaped-ux-designer-1b19927c9125)** describes how being a T-shaped designers helps in dealing with these changes. A generalist horizontal arm contains all the different activities designers do in teams: research, UI design, prototyping, writing, visual design, information architecture. The specialist vertical arm deepens the design expertise in one particular area, up to a very specific expertise in a niche field.

The Spotify team has two articles showing two sides of the coin, how both specialists and generalists need to find their T-shape, **[Finding your T-Shape as a Generalist Designer](https://spotify.design/article/finding-your-t-shape-as-a-generalist-designer)** and **[Finding your T-Shape as a Specialist Designer](https://spotify.design/article/finding-your-t-shape-as-a-specialist-designer)**. Both feature cool stories on the designers' personal journeys. Generalist need to have a basis specialty to anchor their breadth, and to get better as generalist they should build on their specialization. While specialists should look for adjacent generalists skills to balance their specialist skills.

One counter argument to having one specialty in being T-shaped is how difficult it is to be the best or at least in the top with also having the skills on the horizontal arm. A way around is stacking skills, as Tomas Pueyo describes in **[How to Become the Best in the World at Something](https://forge.medium.com/how-to-become-the-best-in-the-world-at-something-f1b658f93428)**. In essence it means to not only get good enough (top 10%) in one skill, but in two or more, thereby having a unique and therefor valuable skillset that allows for solving particular sets of problems.

Being T-shaped becomes important if we are to build effective teams. Jason Yip writes about this in **[Why T-shaped people?](https://jchyip.medium.com/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437)**. Generalists (the horizontal bar of skills) makes teams to be able respond more quickly as everyone can pick up tasks that are incoming. Specialists (the vertical bar of skills) meanwhile can clear bottlenecks quickly as they are more efficient in a particular area. The generalist skills also helps in team communication, as people have some understanding of each other's specialties. The article also describes a few alternative formulations to T-shapedness: icicle-shape, paint drip, pi-shaped, m-shaped, and broken comb shape.

In **[T-shaped skills in every area of your life](https://agileleanlife.com/t-shaped-skills-every-area-life/)** Blaz Kos introduces how being T-shaped skills are more important than ever, as they support the execution, something that is even more important than to just to have an idea about what to do. For example having just having good knowledge is not enough, broader knowledge of the context and soft skills (such as time management and collaboration skills) are also needed to get things done.

An alternative view and formulation to the T-shapedness is **[Kent Beck‚Äôs Paint Drip People](https://flowchainsensei.wordpress.com/2021/07/28/kent-becks-paint-drip-people/)**. As he argues, skills are sometimes much more detached to form a meaningful T, and this metaphor is also not great to show changes over time. Paint drip model of skills is better, since it's a clearer visual metaphor of how skills get developed over time.
