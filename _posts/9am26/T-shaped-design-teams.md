# üç™ Things to snack on

Our craft changes a lot with both the changing expectations towards to role of designers and the changing technological landscape. Eva Schicker's **[The amazing T-shaped UX designer](https://evaschicker2012.medium.com/the-amazing-t-shaped-ux-designer-1b19927c9125)** describes how being a T-shaped designers helps in dealing with these changes. A generalist horisontal arm contains all the different activites designers do in teams: research, UI design, prototyping, writing, visual design, information architecture. The specialist vertical arm deepens the design expertise in one particular area, up to a very specific expertise in a niche field.

**[The Generalized Specialist: How Shakespeare, Da Vinci, and Kepler Excelled](https://fs.blog/generalized-specialist/)** by Farnam Street is a good primer on the differences between generalists and specialists. Generalists are a sort of jack of all trades, while a specialist is a master of a single area. As the article desicribes while they are the opposite, it's actually a spectrum with people excelling in the middle by building a sepcialization on a generalist knowledge.

The Spotify team has two articles showing two sides of the coin, how both specialsts and generalists need to find their T-shape, **[Finding your T-Shape as a Generalist Designer](https://spotify.design/article/finding-your-t-shape-as-a-generalist-designer)** and **[Finding your T-Shape as a Specialist Designer](https://spotify.design/article/finding-your-t-shape-as-a-specialist-designer)**. Both feature cool stories on the designers' personal journeys. Generalist need to have a basis specialty to anchor their breadth, and to get better as generalist they should build on their specialization. While specialists should look for adjecent generalists skills to balance their specialist skills.

One counter argument to having one speciality in being T-shaped is how difficult it is to be the best or at least in the top with also having the the skills on the horisontal arm. A way around is stacking skils, as Tomas Pueyo describes in **[How to Become the Best in the World at Something](https://forge.medium.com/how-to-become-the-best-in-the-world-at-something-f1b658f93428)**. In essence it means to not only get good enough (top 10%) in one skill, but in two or more, thereby having a unique and therefor valuable skillset that allows for solving particular sets of problems. 

Being T-shaped becomes important if we are to build effective teams. Jason Yip writes about this in **[Why T-shaped people?](https://jchyip.medium.com/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437)**. Generalists (the horisontal bar of skills) makes teams to be able respond more quickly as everyone can pick up tasks that are incoming. Specialists (the vertical bar of skills) meanwhile can clear bottlnecks quickly as they are more efficient in a particular area. The generalist sklls also helps in team communication, as people have some understanding of each other's specialities. The article also describes a few alternative formulations to T-shapedness: icicle-shape, paint drip, pi-shaped, m-shaped, and broken comb shape. 

In **[T-shaped skills in every area of your life](https://agileleanlife.com/t-shaped-skills-every-area-life/)** Blaz Kos introduces how being T-shaped skills are more important than ever, as they support the execution, something that is even more important than to just to have an idea about what to do. For example having just having good knowledge is not enough, broader knowledge of the context and soft skills (such as time management and collaboration skills) are also needed to get things done.

An alternative view and formulation to the T-shapedness is **[Kent Beck‚Äôs Paint Drip People](https://flowchainsensei.wordpress.com/2021/07/28/kent-becks-paint-drip-people/)**. As he argues, skills are sometimes much more detached to form a meaningful T, and this metaphor is also not great to show changes over time. Paint drip model of skills is better, since it's a clearer visual metaphor of how skills get developed over time.
