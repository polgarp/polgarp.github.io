# ‚òï Writing great job ads

Best is to have passive pipeline, but second best is.

Remember, this is a job ad and not a job description.

The thing is, each company needs different things to succeed, even when generally describing the package of needs with the same job title.

Also generic terms like creating innovative experiences mean nothing. A simple test always is to think if there are companies who would want the opposite? If you are small startup, would a large enterprise would want the opposite? If needs are the same the term is too generic to be useful.

Avoid things like "family" or being vague

Understandable that what the team or new person is doing today might be not the same what they do in a year, but you should be clear what you need someone for to do in the next 6 month when you get a new headcount. You might need some soul searching if you are not sure.

Active candidates want a job, so more likely to apply. But passive candidates need more inspiration to imagine your team as the next step.

Generally you want input from partners - there should be shared understanding what you want.

Design the job ad, design their journeys.

Instead describing needs day-to-day, describe their journey. Describe onboarding. Share the process - interesting and tells a lot about your organizational culture and manages expectations.

N years of experience means nothing. You did this means more.

You can think about what makes great places of work, what makes your team great place to work and add it. Maybe ask your team to get some ideas.


# üç™ Things to snack on

Jared Spool writes and talks extensively about the hiring process, and especially about creating great job ads:

- The best designers will want to learn certain things about the role, and the job ad should describe those in detail, as **[Your Job Ad: The Start of a Great Hiring Experience](https://articles.uie.com/job_ad/)** explains. Job ads need to be helpful, to be helpful they need to be concrete, and to be concrete the hiring manger needs to understand what are your expectations for the role.
- The **[Thank you note](https://playbook.uie.com/blog/the-thank-you-note-a-sketching-tool-for-ux-hiring)** is a tool to get a better understanding about the position we hire for by sketching how the future employee would benefit the team. Or more precisely we write in the thank you note what are the things we are1 grateful for, that the future employee has done. Similar to design sketches the thank you note can be shared to other stakeholders to make sure there is a common understanding about the position. Writing about what we expect the new team member to do is also a good first step for creating the job ad.
- A more extensive process to describe new roles (at least compared to the thank you note) is the performance profile. A performance profile contains what the organization expects from the new hire and is shared to stakeholders. Jared Spool describes in **[UX Hiring: The Performance Profile is a Game Changer](https://articles.uie.com/ux-hiring-the-performance-profile-is-a-game-changer/)** sections in a performance profile: position summary, position objectives, expected organizational structure (reporting lines, peers for collaboration), situational needs (what makes this role challenging), basic requirements. Getting all these details on paper will help writing the job ad, as expectations and tasks are clearly formulated.

Chris Avore's and Russ Unger's book, **[Liftoff!](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/ux-leadership/)** is generally a great book about design leadership. They write quite extensively about hiring and topics like inclusion, hiring processes, interviews, and offers. There is a great section about using performance profiles, as a basis not only for the job ad but also for the hiring process, and the interview guides.

Emily Esposito describes types of job ads in **[5 UX job ads that will help you hire great designers](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/ux-designer-job-description/)**: Define day-to-day tasks, Clearly define projects, Focus on the why, Promote cultural fit, Lay out the challenges. She gives some examples giving some ideas how to start creating a job ad.

Irene Au's **[Writing a Job Description for UX People](https://medium.com/design-your-life/writing-a-job-description-for-ux-people-bcad01be93b0)** is more targeted to non-designer people hiring designers, as it also gives a longer explanation of various skill sets for designers and UX people as the first step to figure out what's needed. Thinking about the basic skills (like user research, interaction design or visual design) helps non-design leaders better understand what sort of candidate they want. In turn the desired skill set also informs the job ad for more concretes on what's needed to do in the role.

For design leaders, taking the user-centered approach in everything we do comes by nature. That should be also our approach when writing job ads argues Andy Budd in **[How to Write a Job Ad that Doesn't Suck!](https://andybudd.com/archives/2022/04/crafting-effective-job-ads)**. Job ads should focus on things people, especially designers care about as that is what will sell the company and the role to potential candidates. He lists 8 things that people, especially designers care about: disclosing the salary band, listing learning opportunities, talking about culture, showing career opportunities, provide potential candidates with the right job titles, describing an attractive work environment, sharing a story that people can belong to or excited about, and most importantly the company's commitment to design. He also gives great examples for each. I thought the most important message was (besides including the salary) to think about what the candidates would look for as a human.
