# ‚òï Writing great job ads


The thing is, each company needs different things to succeed, even when generally describing the package of needs with the same job title.

Also generic terms like creating innovative experiences mean nothing. A simple test always is to think if there are companies who would want the opposite? If you are small startup, would a large enterprise would want the opposite? If needs are the same the term is too generic to be useful.

Avoid things like "family" or being vague

Understandable that what the team or new person is doing today might be not the same what they do in a year, but you should be clear what you need someone for to do in the next 6 month when you get a new headcount. You might need some soul searching if you are not sure.

Active candidates want a job, so more likely to apply. But passive candidates need more inspiration to imagine your team as the next step.

Generally you want input from partners - there should be shared understanding what you want.

Design the job ad, design their journeys.

Instead describing needs day-to-day, describe their journey. Describe onboarding. Share the process - interesting and tells a lot about your organisational culture and manages expectations.

N years of experience means nothing. You did this means more.

Chris Avore's and Russ Unger's book, **[Liftoff!](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/ux-leadership/)** is generally a great book about design leadership, and they write quite extensively about hiring. Performance profiles as a basis not only for the job description but also for the hiring guide.

Jered Spool writes and talks extensively about this crucial part of the hiring process:
