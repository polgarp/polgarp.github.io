# ‚òï Building portfolios with experience stories

While reviewing portfolios I look for a few things, most importantly if the person is capable of learning and has the skills I'm looking for - beyond being able to produce pretty artifacts. This is often not obvious or even plain not visible by just looking at most portfolios. 

Another issue I frequently encounter while checking portfolios and even mentoring designers is the lack of progress in their approaches. They do a webshop, and afterwards another webshop and so on. 10 years of career, and it's the same 1 year worth of project 10 times. This often results in designers being stuck with mid-level tasks, unable to move to more strategic levels and level up in their careers.

I found an approach for both of these problems:
1. Systematic reflections to understand learning over time and experiment.
2. Compiling learning into stories to be told that crystallizes improvement and can help formulate portfolio items.

I call these these stories "experience stories" to distinguish from other type of stories we have in product development. Experience stories are not neccessarily the portfolio elements itself, they are more summaries of experience and learning obtained. 

When designers start out in their careers, a single project results in a lot of learning. A junior learns how projects are done, how to collaborate with peers and how they should apply their design skills. As they get more senior, learning will be less about execution, but more about process, collaboration and communication. Portfolio items should reflect this. 

It all starts with reflection, understanding how things went on past projects, describing learning and deciding on what to try differently in future projects. Reflection takes time with potential pay off far in the future, so many designers don't make enough time for it. One outcome of reflection are portfolio elements. Hence many designers only create portfolios when they are looking for a new job, and this results in fairly shallow portfolios with relatively information and learning poor items.

This where the second step helps. Thinking in stories adds structure and provides a way for reflecting. Stories are not designed in a single run, rather get better over time as they get told, presented, written down again and again. The essence of story doesn't show itself immediately, it needs shaping. Sometimes the learning doesn't even happen immediately, but over longer periods of time. We realize in hindsight how strategy or approach at past projects was failed or can be improved upon.

Contrary to static portfolio items, stories can be customized to different contexts. Stories don't stand on their own, but shaped by the storyteller and received by the audience - the final form depends on both sides. As such elements can be changed, but the main message, so the core of the designers learning, will remain the same.

SG-sg about how

A nice scaffolding for your experience stories is the STAR framework, so Situation, Task, Action Result.
What should be your story about? It's not just about getting as many stories as possible, also as your progress on your career, your stories depth will change according to a few dimensions (we are still in the process of figuring these out).
As a rough rule of thumb if you are on‚Ä¶:
- Intern level: your first adventures as a professional
- Junior level: Perfecting your methods / tools, adopting new ones, focusing on the tactical part. Impact on a personal level. Results are outputs.
- Medior level: Adopting your methods / tools / processes in new contexts, innovate by adopting them to new contexts. Impact on a team level. Results are outcomes for the cutomers.
- Senior level: Creating new tools / methods / process depending on context, innovative use of basic principles / approaches. Impact on the broader org. Results are business outcomes.
So in short as you learn, you will go deeper and also wider, and stories should reflect this progress‚Ää-‚Ääotherwise it's just repeating routine work.

So here are some principles for a great story to get you started:
1. Show your best work.
2. Craft your narrative.
3. Be honest and clear.
4. Frame the problems and the goals.
5. Expose how you think.
6. Reveal your context.¬†
7. Present your solution and the journey.
8. Celebrate your accomplishments.
9. Reflect upon your learnings.

Principles for evaluating an experience story:
- Level-appropriate: the higher you go, the more depth should your stories carry. For mastery it's also important to have the knowledge for the lower levels, so no rushing forward.
‚Ää-‚ÄäIt's a story: have some narrative structure, like the STAR model or something similar. This also helps to have substance, so not just a bunch of images and bullet points, but a logical structure that explains what happened
‚Ää-‚ÄäShow the learning: how did this story made you a better designer / researcher for the future?
‚Ää-‚ÄäStyle: clear and honest writing, no mish-mash of what happened. Short, but contains links to artifacts.
Must have:
Competence displayed. Even if implicit.
‚Ää-‚ÄäDifferent than other stories (don't repeat, improve)

# üç™ Things to snack on

Writing experience stories is a practice based on **[Double Loop Learning](https://fs.blog/2018/06/double-loop-learning/)**, as described by Farnam Street. Single loop learning happens while we do things like working on projects. Within the established structure, practice gets better over time, but there is no route to dramatically improve. That's where reflection comes in, kicking off double loop learning. Since successful professionals rarely fail, the reflection is limited by both the perceived cost and being defensive on failures, seeking justification outside of established practice. Instead of getting defensive, experience and data can be examined through reflection and new experiments run to test structures - in mindset and approaches. This leads to novel and new approaches.

The power of using stories has a simple reason: **[Great Stories Release Brain Chemicals](https://www.blog.theteamw.com/2016/05/11/the-next-100-things-you-need-to-know-about-people-114-great-stories-release-brain-chemicals/)**, as Susan Weinschenk writes. There are common plot points that resonate with people and form archetypal stories (Overcoming a monster, Rags to riches, The quest, Voyage and return, Comedy, Tragedy, Rebirth). Some of these stories (like The quest) fit well portfolio descriptions, and give a recognizable narrative framework. The stories made of common plot points are easy to understand to people. Listening to such stories release brain chemicals, so results in direct physical change, that makes it easier to connect with. This explains why stories are so powerful if we want to transmit information.

Telling your stories is just as important for growth as the story itself, writes Simon Pan in **[Great Design Portfolios Are Great Stories](https://medium.com/interactive-mind/great-design-portfolios-are-great-stories-7bb2617cd7ab)**. He also has some advice how to prepare a portfolio pieces that tells a story and craft a narrative around the work done. 

Your experiences should be shaped shaped into stories as something that will be read or listened. The easiest form for this are presentations, and Jonathan Walter has a lot of useful tips about these in **[Telling a Story Through Your Portfolio Presentation](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2019/06/telling-a-story-through-your-portfolio-presentation.php)**. The article details how most projects can be applied the common story structure of Exposition - Rising Action - Climax - Falling action - Denouement. This needs to shaped into a presentation too - probably a longer project story can go together with multiple shorter project highlights. The article also remarks that the best stories are told effectively, this is where storytelling skills can shine.

Budi Tanrim gives a simple framework for writing about projects, as he argues it helps making sense of things in **[Making sense of your design project by writing ](https://buditanrim.co/2020/making-sense-of-your-design-project-by-writing/)**. Just like more generally in design, once things are on paper, it's easier to spot unclear things that needs further followup. This also shows how thinking in stories also helps much earlier in design work, not only when creating a portfolio piece. The starter questions he shares are also good to think about when creating a portfolio piece:
* Why did your team start it in the first place?
* Who is the target audience?
* What is the customer problem we‚Äôre trying to solve?
* What data do we have to back up this argument?
* Why is this worth solving?
* How is this useful for the company?
