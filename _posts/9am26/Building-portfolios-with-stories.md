# ‚òï Building portfolios with stories

Projects don't highlight learning particularly well.

Stories also allow to customise to the audience.


Crafting portfolios
Different companies have different needs, so everyone looks at kinda different things in a portfolio, if the company is honest enough (or at least they have a good enough process) the things they are looking for are kinda the things they describe in the job ad. I usually hire "product designers"‚Ää-‚Äämeaning designers who can create full products from first concepts to the delivery phase, and in the case of Trustpilot even able to do some research. Here "UX" and "UI" are not really differentiated, rather "research" and "design". So when I look at a portfolio I'd want to see more than a few images that show the end result, but rather the story as you wrote, so what was the process. I think the best ones I saw so far also had a kinda authentic voice that also talked about the lessons learned‚Ää-‚Ääa portfolio with 5‚Äì10 projects that are kinda the same are not that interesting. But showing how the 2‚Äì3 most interesting projects had made you a better designer helps me to understand your journey so far, how that would fit into the team I'm recruiting for, and how I may be able to help you grow further. Some of the more specific things I'm looking for, if the portfolio pieces have enough "depth" (so not just a few landing pages or a trivial webshop), were indeed products, or just agency style design work, the quality (not necessarily visual, can be interaction or writing) and the care (maybe the portfolio is personalized, includes something that shows the candidate is ready to go the extra mile). I usually don't do a strong filtering based on the filtering, just look at it if it contains any of the positive signs, rather trying to find mistakes (spelling errors and the wrong margins are bad signs, but not enough to refuse something‚Ää-‚Ääthe truth the everyone lacks good designers, so wanna make sure we are not disqualifying early somebody who could be otherwise a good fit). The pieces are a good conversations starters though, and is something I like to get back on the initial interviews.

Principles for evaluating an experience story:
- Level-appropriate: the higher you go, the more depth should your stories carry. For mastery it's also important to have the knowledge for the lower levels, so no rushing forward.
‚Ää-‚ÄäIt's a story: have some narrative structure, like the STAR model or something similar. This also helps to have substance, so not just a bunch of images and bullet points, but a logical structure that explains what happened
‚Ää-‚ÄäShow the learning: how did this story made you a better designer / researcher for the future?
‚Ää-‚ÄäStyle: clear and honest writing, no mish-mash of what happened. Short, but contains links to artifacts.
Must have:
Competence displayed. Even if implicit.
‚Ää-‚ÄäDifferent than other stories (don't repeat, improve)

A nice scaffolding for your experience stories is the STAR framework, so Situation, Task, Action Result.
What should be your story about? It's not just about getting as many stories as possible, also as your progress on your career, your stories depth will change according to a few dimensions (we are still in the process of figuring these out).
As a rough rule of thumb if you are on‚Ä¶:
- Intern level: your first adventures as a professional
- Junior level: Perfecting your methods / tools, adopting new ones, focusing on the tactical part. Impact on a personal level. Results are outputs.
- Medior level: Adopting your methods / tools / processes in new contexts, innovate by adopting them to new contexts. Impact on a team level. Results are outcomes for the cutomers.
- Senior level: Creating new tools / methods / process depending on context, innovative use of basic principles / approaches. Impact on the broader org. Results are business outcomes.
So in short as you learn, you will go deeper and also wider, and stories should reflect this progress‚Ää-‚Ääotherwise it's just repeating routine work.
So here are some principles for a great story to get you started:
1. Show your best work.
2. Craft your narrative.
3. Be honest and clear.
4. Frame the problems and the goals.
5. Expose how you think.
6. Reveal your context.¬†
7. Present your solution and the journey.
8. Celebrate your accomplishments.
9. Reflect upon your learnings.

# üç™ Things to snack on

The power of using stories has a simple reason: **[Great Stories Release Brain Chemicals](https://www.blog.theteamw.com/2016/05/11/the-next-100-things-you-need-to-know-about-people-114-great-stories-release-brain-chemicals/)**, as Susan Weinschenk writes. There are common plot points that resonate with people and form archetypal stories (Overcoming a monster, Rags to riches, The quest, Voyage and return, Comedy, Tragedy, Rebirth). Some of these stories (like The quest) fit well portfolio descriptions, and give a recognizable narrative framework. The stories made of common plot points are easy to understand to people. Listening to such stories release brain chemicals, so results in direct physical change, that makes it easier to connect with. This explains why stories are so powerful if we want to transmit information.

Telling your stories is just as important for growth as the story itself, writes Simon Pan in **[Great Design Portfolios Are Great Stories](https://medium.com/interactive-mind/great-design-portfolios-are-great-stories-7bb2617cd7ab)**. He also has some advice how to prepare a portfolio pieces that tells a story and craft a narrative around the work done. 


**[Double Loop Learning](https://fs.blog/2018/06/double-loop-learning/)** by Farnam Street

Your experiences should be shaped shaped into stories as something that will be read or listened. The easiest form for this are presentations, and Jonathan Walter has a lot of useful tips about these in **[Telling a Story Through Your Portfolio Presentation](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2019/06/telling-a-story-through-your-portfolio-presentation.php)**. The article details how most projects can be applied the common story structure of Exposition - Rising Action - Climax - Falling action - Denouement. This needs to shaped into a presentation too - probably a longer project story can go together with multiple shorter project highlights. The article also remarks that the best stories are told effectively, this is where storytelling skills can shine.

Budi Tanrim gives a simple framework for writing about projects, as he argues it helps making sense of things in **[Making sense of your design project by writing ](https://buditanrim.co/2020/making-sense-of-your-design-project-by-writing/)**. Just like more generally in design, once things are on paper, it's easier to spot unclear things that needs further followup. This also shows how thinking in stories also helps much earlier in design work, not only when creating a portfolio piece. The starter questions he shares are also good to think about when creating a portfolio piece:

* Why did your team start it in the first place?
* Who is the target audience?
* What is the customer problem we‚Äôre trying to solve?
* What data do we have to back up this argument?
* Why is this worth solving?
* How is this useful for the company?
