# ☕ 1on1s

You should have 1on1s with your boss. You should do 1:1s with your reports. You should do skip level 1:1s with your report's reports.

We are in this together. But also not exactly together, as you are the boss.

1.  Building Trust: Regular 1:1 meetings provide an opportunity for design leaders to build trust with their direct reports. By having one-on-one conversations with each team member, design leaders can learn about their goals, concerns, and aspirations. This can help leaders tailor their management style to meet the needs of each individual, and help team members feel valued and supported.
    
2.  Encouraging Open Communication: 1:1 meetings also encourage open communication between design leaders and their direct reports. By creating a safe and supportive space, team members are more likely to share their ideas, feedback, and concerns. This can help leaders identify areas of improvement and implement changes that benefit the team as a whole.
    
3.  Setting Goals and Expectations: Regular 1:1 meetings provide an opportunity for design leaders to set clear goals and expectations with their direct reports. By setting expectations early on, team members can focus on their work and strive to meet these goals. This can also help prevent misunderstandings and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
    
4.  Providing Feedback and Coaching: 1:1 meetings are also an opportunity for design leaders to provide feedback and coaching to their direct reports. By providing constructive feedback and coaching, leaders can help their team members grow and develop their skills. This can also help team members feel more engaged and invested in their work.
    
5.  Building a Strong Team: Ultimately, regular 1:1 meetings help design leaders build a strong and cohesive team. By fostering trust, open communication, goal-setting, and coaching, leaders can create an environment where team members feel supported and motivated to do their best work. This can lead to higher job satisfaction, better performance, and ultimately, better design outcomes.
