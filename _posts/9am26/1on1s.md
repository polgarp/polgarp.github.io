# ‚òï 1-on-1s

The weekly 1-on-1 might be not the place where most designer get their first exposure to coaching, but it's definitely where most design leaders need to step into the role of coaches.

Peter Merholz talks about coaching as...

Obviously not about project status (there should be really other ways to talk about those), and really about career, but what does that mean? What else?

You should have 1on1s with your boss. You should do 1:1s with your reports. You should do skip level 1:1s with your report's reports.

Besides workign towards career goals of the designer, also work on the team overall. That means directing improvement according to team strategy or career ladder (that also executes on the team vision and strategy), making connections between team members, getting more seniors to help more junior members etc.

We are in this together. But also not exactly together, as you are the boss.

1.  Building Trust: Regular 1:1 meetings provide an opportunity for design leaders to build trust with their direct reports. By having one-on-one conversations with each team member, design leaders can learn about their goals, concerns, and aspirations. This can help leaders tailor their management style to meet the needs of each individual, and help team members feel valued and supported.
    
2.  Encouraging Open Communication: 1:1 meetings also encourage open communication between design leaders and their direct reports. By creating a safe and supportive space, team members are more likely to share their ideas, feedback, and concerns. This can help leaders identify areas of improvement and implement changes that benefit the team as a whole.
    
3.  Setting Goals and Expectations: Regular 1:1 meetings provide an opportunity for design leaders to set clear goals and expectations with their direct reports. By setting expectations early on, team members can focus on their work and strive to meet these goals. This can also help prevent misunderstandings and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
    
4.  Providing Feedback and Coaching: 1:1 meetings are also an opportunity for design leaders to provide feedback and coaching to their direct reports. By providing constructive feedback and coaching, leaders can help their team members grow and develop their skills. This can also help team members feel more engaged and invested in their work.
    
5.  Building a Strong Team: Ultimately, regular 1:1 meetings help design leaders build a strong and cohesive team. By fostering trust, open communication, goal-setting, and coaching, leaders can create an environment where team members feel supported and motivated to do their best work. This can lead to higher job satisfaction, better performance, and ultimately, better design outcomes.

So how are things different.

1.  Focus on design work: Unlike other teams, design teams typically work on creative projects that require a high level of collaboration and input from leadership. Therefore, 1-on-1 meetings for design leaders should focus on the specifics of design work, such as design thinking methodologies, user research, prototyping, and usability testing.
    
2.  Portfolio reviews: Design leaders should take the time to review the work of individual team members and provide constructive feedback. This can include looking at design portfolios, sketches, wireframes, and other design artifacts to ensure that they meet the organization's standards and design principles.
    
3.  Support for career growth: Design leaders should also use 1-on-1 meetings to help team members develop their skills and advance their careers. This can include discussing career goals, identifying areas for improvement, and providing mentorship and coaching.
    
4.  Collaboration with other teams: Design leaders should use 1-on-1 meetings to collaborate with other teams, such as product, engineering, and marketing, to ensure that design is integrated into the larger product development process. This can include discussing design requirements, presenting design concepts, and working through design challenges.
    
5.  Communication and feedback: Design leaders should use 1-on-1 meetings to build strong relationships with team members, establish trust, and provide regular feedback. This can include discussing project progress, providing recognition for good work, and addressing any concerns or challenges that team members may be facing.
