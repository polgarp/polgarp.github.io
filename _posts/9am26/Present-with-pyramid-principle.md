# ‚òï Present with the pyramid principle

I wish more designers would create their presentations more strategically. There are many types of presentation, most of it are ways to use and experiment with storytelling. But where the medium of presentation needs more than casual storytelling is usually where the goal is to influence stakeholders.

There are a few situations where influencing matters, like presenting research results pitching a problem to solve, trying to get momentum for a vision and direction, or looking for approval and support for a solution. All of these is typically involving stakeholders from outside the immediate team, who might have a holistic perspective lacking specific context details, but have some power to move things forward.



>About slides

Obviously, slides are an imperfect way of containging ideas, but also they provide constraints on expression which in itself is useful.

The first thing critical to recognize, that while people


Sometimes people think about presenting like telling a joke, the punchline is at the end. Imagine the presentation should be something where you lead people through your process. In a lot of cases the process is less important than the outcome. With pyramid principle, it's the opposite, you'd be telling the key information first, and if there is interest, dive into details and data. 

>found the pyramid principle a good one

>how the principle works

We often talk about importance of storytelling  - the pyramid principle is a great way to construct stories, gives a clear method to come up with a storyline.


>good way to start: mindmaps



>how we used

>a way to organize nuggets

There are ideas that are persisstent, maybe within a project, or maybe on the longer term.

>a way to organize more

It's often needed to do a similar presentations over and over again, as the project progresses, as you work with different stakeholders.
And this applies also to portfolio presentations.

# üç™ Things to snack on

**Daniel Good** offers a good summary of the original book in [**üìñ The Pyramid Principle**](https://medium.com/make-work-better/the-pyramid-principle-6705da58c582). This summary also points out that the method doesn't always work, as it was created to support how consultants work. It doesn't help formulate answers (the analysis and solution finding needs to be done earlier), and is less good at more collaborative approaches.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅÉ</p>

[**The Pyramid Principle: How To Craft Coherent Explanations**](https://jeffkavanaugh.net/pyramid-principle-craft-coherent-explanations/) is a straightforward explanation of the concept by **Jeff Kavanaugh**, mostly focused on how it serves to convince people. 

A significant context where the pyramid principle is very helpful are research summaries, where results from the studies should influence. **Christopher K Wong** writes about this in [**Improve UX research presentations with 3 minor writing tweaks**](https://dataanddesign.substack.com/p/improve-ux-research-presentations). The tips here show how to apply the principle in practice - include key takeaways in titles, use bullet points as summaries of findings, and highlight takeaways from user quotes. 

Describing ideas in a more permanent way comes from the concept of evergreens. A short summary of this idea by **Maggie Appleton** in [**Growing the Evergreens**](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens).

The method is not only for presentations, it works for other forms of communication too. For example, **Raquel Piqueras** writes about how to write effective emails in [**Use the Pyramid Principle to improve your influence and get design buy-in**](https://uxdesign.cc/use-the-pyramid-principle-to-improve-your-influence-and-get-design-buy-in-1a736fa1e54a), with a few examples, including concrete tips for pitching an idea, requesting feedback, and solving a problem.
