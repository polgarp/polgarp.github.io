# ☕ Present with the pyramid principle

This one is about making better presentations, but is actually as much about describing your knowledge better.


I wish more designers would create their presentations more strategically.

There are ideas that are persisstent, maybe within a project, or maybe on the longer term.

Obviously, slides are an imperfect way of containging ideas, but also they provide constraints on expression which in itself is useful.

It's often needed to do a similar presentations over and over again, as the project progresses, as you work with different stakeholders.

And this applies also to portfolio presentations. 

We often talk about importance of storytelling  - the pyramid principle is a great way to construct stories, gives a clear method to come up with a storyline.
