# ‚òï Team rituals

When I started leading a team, one of the first things I needed to figure out how to make sure we are not just a team of designers but a design team. Meaning we have a common purpose, we help each other, we work together on the overall UX, and we help each other to grow. 

The most common tool for a leader is to create spaces and rituals for the team members to talk about their work, get feedback and support each other. The most common way for these are sync meetings.

Now meetings often get a bad rep, as something that takes time away from work, and it's true most meetings could be better design, even design meetings. Ofourse a lot of them could have been an email. But the thing is, reading something written takes a lot of discipline to get through and act on. Plus a lot of thoughtful crafting from the writers side. Even if this seems cheaper (a common argument for not holding meetings), it might be more expensive for a lot of the kinda-important type of meetings.

For distributed teams

Meetings for the design team fulfill a few particular objectives:
- Alignment and communication. Distributed design teams are still responsible for a shared user journey. So being aware of what's going on elsewhere in the experience helps to find common points, goals, and gaps that strengthen the overall work.
- Safe space for feedback and ideas. Since designers probably spend most of their time with non-designers, getting back to their tribe and having a safe place to share ideas, and recieve feedback 
- Progress tracking
- Learning ad growth
- Team cohesion. Needs to build a professional team. While being friends is not a requirement, having a good working relationship, respect and camaraderie. 

Based on these a few common type of meetings I had in the past. Each of needs to tick a few boxes from the previous team

# üç™ Things to snack on

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅÉ</p>

One problem with meetings is that they are often frames as something done instead of work. There are reasons why this is not true, and **Elizabeth Ayer** has some compelling arguments why [**Meetings *are* the work**](https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/meetings-are-the-work-9e429dde6aa3). At least in the case of knowledge workers who are supposed to make decisions, like designers.

**Fabiana Alegrio** and **Shubham Shreya** write about the interesting challenge of figuring out common rituals for remote design teams merging in [**How we redefined rituals to optimize cross-team and cross-location collaboration**](https://medium.com/zalando-design/how-we-redefined-rituals-to-optimize-cross-team-and-cross-location-collaboration-b10a4638a471). The minimum common denominator for designers seems a critique practice, and relaxed social event to find connections between people. 

[**How We Structure Design Team Meetings at OneSignal**](https://onesignal.com/blog/design-team-meetings/) is a detailed list of meetings of the design team at OneSignal by **Lee Munroe** with a lot of small tips and details on running these. 

[**Design Team Rituals at Alcumus**](https://medium.com/alcumus-design/design-team-rituals-at-alcumus-981f11632c1e) by **Catherine Kazmir** is also a description of what meetings a design team has, with additional info how they changed their meetings after some issues emerged. A curious part is how they combine sync and async meetings to stay aligned.

[**Ceremonies of a design team**](https://uxdesign.cc/ceremonies-of-a-design-team-2abe91b97cdd) is another description of design team meetings. This is from Threefold, written by **Shane Doyle**, and is a nice insight into the goals served and how to structure each of the team rituals.

"At the furthest extremes, design team meetings can often resemble something out of Lord of the Flies where chaos reigns and there is absolutely no plan" ‚Äî **Yael Levey** writes about how each type of design meeting has to serve a clear purpose in [**Improve your design team meetings: Three tips for greatness!**](https://www.iamnotmypixels.com/three-tips-to-make-your-design-team-meetings-actually-worthwhile/). These are: showcasing expertise, sharing and collaborating on work, and practicing soft skills.
