# ‚òï Team rituals

Ceremony or ritual
Communication, align, 

Offourse a lot of meetings could have been an email, but the thing is, reading something written takes a lot of discipline to get through and act on, plus a lot of thoughtful crafting from the writers side. Even if this seems cheaper (a common argument for not holding meetings), it might be more expensive for a lot of the middle stakes type of meetings.

# üç™ Things to snack on

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅÉ</p>

One problem with meetings is that they are often frames as something done instead of work. There are many reasons why this is not true, but **Elizabeth Ayer** has some compelling arguments why [**Meetings *are* the work**](https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/meetings-are-the-work-9e429dde6aa3), at least in the case of knowledge workers, like designers.

**Fabiana Alegrio** and **Shubham Shreya** write about the interesting challenge of figuring out common rituals for remote design teams merging in [**How we redefined rituals to optimize cross-team and cross-location collaboration**](https://medium.com/zalando-design/how-we-redefined-rituals-to-optimize-cross-team-and-cross-location-collaboration-b10a4638a471). The minimum common denominator for designers seems a critique practice, and relaxed social event to find connections between people. 

[**How We Structure Design Team Meetings at OneSignal**](https://onesignal.com/blog/design-team-meetings/) is a detailed list of meetings of the design team at OneSignal by **Lee Munroe** with a lot of small tips and details on running these. 

[**Design Team Rituals at Alcumus**](https://medium.com/alcumus-design/design-team-rituals-at-alcumus-981f11632c1e) by **Catherine Kazmir** is also a description of what meetings a design team has, with additional info how they changed their meetings after some issues emerged. An interesting part is how they combine sync and async meetings to stay aligned.

[**Ceremonies of a design team**](https://uxdesign.cc/ceremonies-of-a-design-team-2abe91b97cdd) is another description of design team meetings. This is from Threefold, written by **Shane Doyle**, and is a nice insight into the goals served and how to structure each of the team rituals.

"At the furthest extremes, design team meetings can often resemble something out of Lord of the Flies where chaos reigns and there is absolutely no plan" - **Yael Levey** writes about how each type of design meeting has to serve a clear purpose in [**Improve your design team meetings: Three tips for greatness!**](https://www.iamnotmypixels.com/three-tips-to-make-your-design-team-meetings-actually-worthwhile/). These are: showcasing expertise, sharing and collaborating on work, and practicing soft skills.
