# ☕ Personas are meant to be used, not just created

I've been seeing portfolios recently, where the designer shows personas as part of their process. They describe the creation of personas, and display them as pretty looking artifacts. But somehow these personas don't have any impact on the design process afterwards, they are just there as a sort-of unrelated but mandatory step.

Part of the issue is how rigidly the design process is perceived (and sometimes taught), with personas as step between user research, and solution ideas starts. Of course, it might be just an issue of presentation — artifacts are easier to show in a portfolio, and describing process details in later steps is less interesting compared to actually showing UI iterations. But if we take working on the experience seriously, who is the user needs to be key point, and shine through the design process and the artifacts.

So this got me thinking on what are the good practices of using personas in the design process.

Personas are a method to aggregate user research done, create a shared understanding on who the users are, and align the team on who is the target. Ofcourse personas are not the only way to describe the audience (like JTBD), but they are a great way to focus the discussion about who the users are.

In some sense, personas act as a shortcut in conversation throughout the product development process. Provided they are based on actual user research and the team can easily connect to them. There are some ways to this, most obviously making it a team effort helps (so workshops), but actively taking care of them (iterating and promoting) is also important.

The easiest way to get started with using personas is just start replacing each mention of "users" or "customers" with an actual persona name when designing and talking about problems and solutions. This will immediately force the personas to be well understood and useful, as whoever is in the discussion needs to understand clearly who exactly we mean, and what are their attributes. Using them consistently will also drive iterations to remove data points from a persona that is generally not useful within the design process (as it's often the case with demographics), and clarifying others (like the context of use).

Most probably this is also a good way to showcase how personas did have an impact on the design process,. For example when describing problems solved, instead of writing *We wanted users to have an easy way to find books*, it's better to have *We wanted Frequent Reader Fred to have an easy way to find books*. This also showcases how and why certain design tradeoffs were made.

There are three more places where I found personas to be especially useful, setting the goals for designing, coming up with better ideas, and making prioritization more deliberate. 

For setting the goals for design, I've written about [**expressing the intent**]({ % post_url 9am26/2023-02-20-Design-intent-describes-what-the-we-set-out-to-achieve %}) via a design brief earlier. Together with the goal, the key scenarios and the principles, personas are needed to set the stage and boundaries for the space to explore. These provide a consistent statement to look at in the messy middle of the design process.

In coming up with new and valuable ideas, personas provide context and narrative that help in coming up with better ideas. Whether it's in a design studio or generating answers to HMWs, thinking about somebody concrete increases empathy (by making it more personal) and helps coming up with more specific while opening up broader solution spaces.



Three more places: brief, ideation, prioritisation. 

Through the complete process beyond the immediate design process, development and marketing. 

Getting this change is hard, some personas are just not that useful, since they are not made with real user research in mind. But more often I've seen how they are created more of an artifact to be looked at, and not an artifact to be used. This needs iteration, testing,

# 🍪 Things to snack on

**Tamara Adlin**'s and **John Pruitt**'s [**The Essential Persona Lifecycle**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-essential-persona/9780123814180/) is a great book about using personas in general, and their role during the product design process in particular. Chapter 6 (Persona adulthood) goes in the nice detail how they would be used in all phases: plan, design, evaluate, and release.

<p style="text-align: center;">🁓</p>

Personas are helpful during ideation, the initial exploration of the solution space, as they provide an anchor point to tie new ideas to. [**Scenario Mapping: Design Ideation Using Personas**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scenario-mapping-personas/) by **Kim Salazar** describes a workshop technique for this, centered around describing the problems a persona would be facing, through a simple narrative description of their activities. 

<p style="text-align: center;">🁓</p>

One way personas are useful is that they create a common understanding among the team members. This helps in focusing and uniting beliefs and knowledge people have about the users. **Jeff Gothelf** has a really nice case in [**Using personas for executive alignment**](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/using-personas-for-executive-alignment/) for not only creating personas, but immediately putting them to use in a design studio.

<p style="text-align: center;">🁓</p>

[**Beware the Cut ‘n’ Paste Persona**](https://alistapart.com/article/beware-the-cut-n-paste-persona/) is both a thoughtful critique of personas, and an interesting method for an alternative that ties more closely into the design process. **Emanuela Cozzi** and **Lennart Overkamp** describe some of the problems with most personas and offer a different approach, which they call dynamic selves, focused more on the context of users. These create patterns that highlight opportunity areas for design exploration. 

<p style="text-align: center;">🁓</p>

Personas are also useful beyond the immediate design process, as they can be added to the usual user story format most agile teams use. **Patrick Neeman**'s [**Why I love user stories**](https://www.usabilitycounts.com/2013/10/11/why-i-love-user-stories/) has some details about using them as a designer.
