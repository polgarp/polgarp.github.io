I've been seeing a lot of portfolios recently, where the designer described the process of creating personas, usually after the interviews or sometimes without any user research there is a fully defined persona, that somehow didn't have any impact on the design process afterwards, so I thought It makes sense to summarize this.

Ofcourse it might be just an issue of presentation - artifacts get into a portfolio, and describing process details is less interesting. But if we take working on the experience seriously, who is the user needs to be key point and shine through the design process.

I've been looking at a lot of portfolios recently, and while I'm seeing a lot of personas being made, I see way less personas being used in the design process. As if creating personas is a mandatory step in the process without much purpose. 

Maybe the questions is broader - if user research is done, how does it's results actually inform the design?

[**Beware the Cut ‚Äòn‚Äô Paste Persona**](https://alistapart.com/article/beware-the-cut-n-paste-persona/) is both a thoughtful critique of personas, and a clear method for an alternative that ties into the design process. **Emanuela Cozzi** and **Lennart Overkamp** describe some of the problems with most personas and offer a different approach, which they call dynamic selves, focused more on the context of users. These create patterns that highlight opportunity areas for design exploration. 

Personas are also useful beyond the immediate design process, as they can be added to the usual user story format most agile teams use. **Patrick Neeman**'s [**Why I love user stories**](https://www.usabilitycounts.com/2013/10/11/why-i-love-user-stories/) has some details about using them as a designer.

One way personas are useful is that they create a common understanding among the team members. This helps in focusing and uniting beliefs and knowledge people have about the users. **Jeff Gothelf** has a really nice case in [**Using personas for executive alignment**](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/using-personas-for-executive-alignment/) for not only creating personas, but immediately putting them to use in a design studio.
