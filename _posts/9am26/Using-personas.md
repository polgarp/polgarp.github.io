# ☕ Personas are meant to be used, not just created

I've been seeing some portfolios recently, where the designer shows some personas as part of their process. They describe the creation of personas, and some pretty looking artifacts. But somehow these personas don't have any impact on the design process afterwards, they are just there as a sort-of unrelated but mandatory step.

Now part of the issue is how design process is perceived (and sometimes taught), with personas as step synthesizing user research done, before design starts. Of course, it might be just an issue of presentation — artifacts get into a portfolio, and describing process details in later steps is less interesting compared to actually showing UI. But if we take working on the experience seriously, who is the user needs to be key point, and shine through the design process.

But it got me thinking on what are good practices using personas in the design process.

Persona is a method to aggregate user research done, create a shared understanding on who the users are, and align the team on who is the target. Ofcourse personas are not the only way to describe the audience, but something needs to focus the discussion about who our users are.

In some sense, personas act as a shortcut in conversation throughout the product development process. Provided they are based on actual user research and the team can actually connect to them. There are some ways to this, most obviously making it a team effort helps (so workshops), but actively taking care of them (iterating and promoting) is also important.

Besides creating personas based on user research, and using them whenever 
Maybe the questions is broader - if user research is done, how does it's results actually inform the design?


On the simplest way, just replace user everywhere

Three more places: brief, ideation, prioritisation. 

Through the complete process beyond the immediate design process, development and marketing. 

Getting this change is hard, some personas are just not that useful, since they are not made with real user research in mind. But more often I've seen how they are created more of an artifact to be looked at, and not an artifact to be used. This needs iteration, testing,

# 🍪 Things to snack on

**Tamara Adlin**'s and **John Pruitt**'s [**The Essential Persona Lifecycle**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-essential-persona/9780123814180/) is a great book about using personas in general, and their role during the product design process in particular. Chapter 6 (Persona adulthood) goes in the nice detail how they would be used in all phases: plan, design, evaluate, and release.

Personas are helpful during ideation, the initial exploration of the solution space, as they provide an anchor point to tie new ideas to. [**Scenario Mapping: Design Ideation Using Personas**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scenario-mapping-personas/) by **Kim Salazar** describes a workshop technique for this, centered around describing the problems a persona would be facing, through a simple narrative description of their activities. 

<p style="text-align: center;">🁓</p>

One way personas are useful is that they create a common understanding among the team members. This helps in focusing and uniting beliefs and knowledge people have about the users. **Jeff Gothelf** has a really nice case in [**Using personas for executive alignment**](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/using-personas-for-executive-alignment/) for not only creating personas, but immediately putting them to use in a design studio.

<p style="text-align: center;">🁓</p>

[**Beware the Cut ‘n’ Paste Persona**](https://alistapart.com/article/beware-the-cut-n-paste-persona/) is both a thoughtful critique of personas, and an interesting method for an alternative that ties more closely into the design process. **Emanuela Cozzi** and **Lennart Overkamp** describe some of the problems with most personas and offer a different approach, which they call dynamic selves, focused more on the context of users. These create patterns that highlight opportunity areas for design exploration. 

<p style="text-align: center;">🁓</p>

Personas are also useful beyond the immediate design process, as they can be added to the usual user story format most agile teams use. **Patrick Neeman**'s [**Why I love user stories**](https://www.usabilitycounts.com/2013/10/11/why-i-love-user-stories/) has some details about using them as a designer.
