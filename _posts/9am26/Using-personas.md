# ☕ Personas are meant to be used, not just created

I've been seeing some portfolios recently, where the designer has some personas as part of their process. They describe the creation of personas, or sometimes the personas are just there hinted as an obvious step in the process. But somehow these personas didn't have any impact on the design process afterwards, they are just there as a sort-of unrelated step.

Now part of the issue is the impact of bootcamps

Ofcourse it might be just an issue of presentation - artifacts get into a portfolio, and describing process details is less interesting. But if we take working on the experience seriously, who is the user needs to be key point and shine through the design process.


Personas aggregate and or align. Some researcgh is needed, at least to inform.
Maybe the questions is broader - if user research is done, how does it's results actually inform the design?
Ofcourse personas are not the only way to describe the audiene, but something needs 

On the simplest way, just replace user everywhere

Through the complete process beyond the immediate design process.

Use in briefs.

# 🍪 Things to snack on

**Tamara Adlin**'s and **John Pruitt**'s [**The Essential Persona Lifecycle**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-essential-persona/9780123814180/) is a great book about using personas in general, and their role during the product design process in particular. Chapter 6 (Persona adulthood) goes in the nice detail how they would be used in all phases: plan, design, evaluate, and release.

Personas are helpful during ideation, the initial exploration of the solution space, as they provide an anchor point to tie new ideas to. [**Scenario Mapping: Design Ideation Using Personas**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scenario-mapping-personas/) by **Kim Salazar** describes a workshop technique for this, centered around describing the problems a persona would be facing, through a simple narrative description of their activities.

One way personas are useful is that they create a common understanding among the team members. This helps in focusing and uniting beliefs and knowledge people have about the users. **Jeff Gothelf** has a really nice case in [**Using personas for executive alignment**](https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/using-personas-for-executive-alignment/) for not only creating personas, but immediately putting them to use in a design studio.

[**Beware the Cut ‘n’ Paste Persona**](https://alistapart.com/article/beware-the-cut-n-paste-persona/) is both a thoughtful critique of personas, and an interesting method for an alternative that ties more closely into the design process. **Emanuela Cozzi** and **Lennart Overkamp** describe some of the problems with most personas and offer a different approach, which they call dynamic selves, focused more on the context of users. These create patterns that highlight opportunity areas for design exploration.

Personas are also useful beyond the immediate design process, as they can be added to the usual user story format most agile teams use. **Patrick Neeman**'s [**Why I love user stories**](https://www.usabilitycounts.com/2013/10/11/why-i-love-user-stories/) has some details about using them as a designer.
