# ‚òï Problem space - solution space

Problem space and solution space are two terms every designer seems to just get, while still not use correctly to guide their design process.

Double diamond representation sort of hides how the two spaces are connected and there needs to be a back and forth interaction, rather than separated phases.

Exploring both spaces at once with prototypes.

Collaboration - more working with pm in problem space, more working with engineering in solution, product trios collab has a rhythym.

In discovery we explore these spaces. Establish the shape of the space, what points are worth exploring in detail

Double diamond is one of the more well-known representations of these two concepts.

But are they separate? During discovery you are exploring both.

Research explores problem space. Prototypes explore the solution space.

Solution space - explore for customer's active need (they already know what is their problem, want a solution). Problem space: explore for latent need (can't define what's their problem or their solution)


Introduction: As a design leader, understanding the dynamics of the problem space and solution space is crucial for guiding your team towards successful product outcomes. In this article, we will explore five essential points that every product designer should consider when working with the problem space and solution space.

1.  Embrace a User-Centric Approach:

* Begin by thoroughly understanding the problem space through user research and empathy-building exercises. Gain deep insights into the needs, pain points, and aspirations of your target audience.
* Encourage designers to adopt a user-centric mindset, ensuring that their design decisions are grounded in user needs and preferences throughout the problem-solving process.

2.  Define the Problem Space:

* Clearly articulate and define the problem space to provide a shared understanding among your team. Identify the core challenges and constraints that need to be addressed to solve the problem effectively.
* Utilize tools like problem statements, user personas, and journey maps to crystallize the problem space, creating a foundation for exploration and ideation.

3.  Foster Creative Exploration in the Solution Space:

* Once the problem space is well-understood, empower your team to explore the solution space by generating a wide range of ideas and concepts.
* Encourage divergent thinking and provide an environment that values experimentation, iteration, and risk-taking. Emphasize that the goal at this stage is to explore various possibilities without prematurely converging on a single solution.

4.  Iterate and Validate:

* Designers should rapidly iterate and refine their solutions based on continuous feedback loops. Encourage a culture of user testing and prototyping to validate assumptions and ensure the proposed solutions effectively address the identified problem space.
* Iterate based on insights gained from user feedback, validating and refining ideas until you arrive at a solution that best solves the problem.

5.  Maintain a Holistic View:

* As a design leader, ensure your team maintains a holistic view of the problem space and solution space throughout the design process.
* Encourage cross-functional collaboration, incorporating inputs from stakeholders such as engineers, marketers, and business strategists, to ensure the proposed solutions are not only desirable to users but also feasible and viable in the larger context.

Conclusion: Navigating the problem space and solution space is a fundamental aspect of product design. By embracing a user-centric approach, defining the problem space, fostering creative exploration, iterating based on user feedback, and maintaining a holistic view, design leaders can guide their teams towards effective solutions that truly address user needs and deliver meaningful outcomes.

**Teresa Torres**'s opportunity solution trees are a great way to give structure to the problem and solution spaces and provide a map to explore it, also guiding product discovery. [**Why This Opportunity Solution Tree is Changing the Way Product Teams Work**](https://www.producttalk.org/2016/08/opportunity-solution-tree/) describes this method.

[**User Research Only Covers Users**](https://medium.com/inclusive-software/user-research-only-covers-users-e46276dd57eb) is a thoughtful critique of how most user research focuses on the solution space by **Indi Young**. Since by definition talking to users puts the existing solution in front and center, only the borders of the solution space will be explorable. To explore the problem space, the person needs to be in the middle, which is an approach from future research. This keeps organizations from figuring out new directions.

**Daniel Mescheder** describes the problem and the solution spaces in a simple, although a bit technical way in [**Problem Space and Solution¬†Space**](https://solutionspace.blog/2021/10/29/problem-space-and-solution-space/). Both have points that represent the problems and the solutions respectively, and each point might be grouped together with other points, related problems and solutions. The difficult part is how to connect the solutions and problems, and how connected problems might not have a connected solution and vica versa.

I liked [**Problem space. Shipping space.**](https://markboulton.co.uk/journal/problem-space-shipping-space/) by **Mark Boulton**, describing how some organizations might be more focused on problem space not only because it seems larger and more interesting, but also by the very nature of the field they are in. Design leaders need to balanced and guide the teams and projects to have an equal focus on both spaces.

While **Jared Spool**'s [**Exploring the Problem Space Through¬†Prototyping**](https://articles.uie.com/four_phases_prototyping/) is more about prototyping, it highlights how solution space and problem space might be explored at the same time with the right tools. The article has some good ideas how prototypes explore the three dimensions of problem space: technology, business and users.
