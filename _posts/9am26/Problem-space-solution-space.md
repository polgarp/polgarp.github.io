# ☕ Problem space - solution space

Collaboration - more working with pm in problem space, more working with engineering in solution, product trios collab has a rhythym.

In discovery we explore these spaces. Establish the shape of the space, what points are worth exploring in detail

Double diamond is one of the more well-known representations of these two concepts.

But are they separate? During discovery you are exploring both.

Research explores problem space. Prototypes explore the solution space.

Solution space - explore for customer's active need (they already know what is their problem, want a solution). Problem space: explore for latent need (can't define what's their problem or their solution)
