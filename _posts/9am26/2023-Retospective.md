# ☕ 2023 Retrospection

2023 is drawing to an end, and it's worth taking a pause, reflect a bit on the year and set some directions for the coming year.

In 2023, I sent 31 newsletters on various design leadership topics — compared to my original goal of 26. Which is to say that I had both a lot of fun writing each episode, and that there is so much more I wish I'd have had time to explore deeper.

I've [started the 9am26 newsletter]({% post_url Blog/2022-04-21-9am26-Newsletter-On-Design-Leadership %}) to learn more, to create starting points for select design leadership topics and to start conversation, and based on my personal assessment I've done well on each of these this year. 

Probably the strongest progress I made was on learning. As it happens, exploring a topic you've worked with before, helps you to see your experiences in a different light, with richer texture, more colors. For example, when I wrote about [design principles]({% post_url 9am26/2023-02-12-Design-principles-set-the-foundation-for-good-design }), I could not only build on how I created design principles on multiple occasions, but realize some higher level patterns, I've never seen while shoulder-deep in the work. Just highlights something I often talk about — the importance and value of reflection.

In 2024 I plan to continue writing biweekly, so 26 episodes overall with more or less the same type of topics. While I'd like to get into even less hot topics (even if writing about the terrible state of the UX industry, or the death of design thinking, or how AI will destroy UX research make all for great viral posts), I have two high level goals. First, I'd like to write more episodes about the business of product design, how our work as individuals and teams is connected to the broader organizations we work in. A lot of teams seem to be confused what they are supposed to do, so exploring this might be helpful. Second, design is a job. But it seems a lot of us are stuck in negative loops that are not helpful to us, nor to the users we are supposed to be working for. So I intend to focus more on topics about personal practices, and how leaders can help their teams to have a more fulfilled and happier career.

**You can always contact me at hello@polgarp.com, I'd be happy to chat about any topic.** I have this in each of my newsletters, and I really mean it. I've written some of the best episodes based on conversations I had with some awesome people, and would love to hear more about your experiences and dilemmas. Worst case — we have a good chat and a coffee pause in our busy days. So if you have a topic you'd like to explore or discuss, just drop me a mail.

May your 2024 be great!

Peter
