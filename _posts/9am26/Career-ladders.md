# ‚òï Career ladders

Some of the toughest conversations I've had with my reports were around promotion and growth. This makes sense, as if we hire people for growth, to be able to improve and increase their impact over time, there needs to be clarity how this should happen. 

The challenge has been always that while as a leader I could easily see why certain team members were not on a senior level yet, it was hard to articulate why exactly. Especially as this needed to be articulated across the team to make sure things are fair for all designers designers without this getting to be a sort of checklist of things to be done. Clearly articulating what is expected across roles and levels needs a common basis and strong vision, this is where having a career ladder helps.

Career ladders are sometimes called progression frameworks. In essence they are a description what is expected for each role in the team at each level and provide general guidance on what is the desired growth path for team members at the organization or company. Having the expectations in writing forces clarity into otherwise vague career and promotion discussions. 

s with everything, writing things down forces clarity into a the otherwise vague discussions.

Also closely related to skill maps, Also helps checking what's missing from the team - in terms of skills.


Informs hiring and helps to understand team members how they can grow their career within the organization. Discuss the importance of creating a culture of growth and development within the design team

Once there 3-4 designers and progression, promotion gets to be a question, this gets brought up.

* Briefly define what a career ladder is
* Explain why having a career ladder is important for design teams

Process is similar to how other team artiefacts are done, this is what worked for me?
- Align with HR / people team. They are experts, maybe there is something to align with. Get clear on how promotion works and how this all aligns with compensation.
- What's the need 
- Research company values and skills needed
- Group and architect skills
- Articulate high level differences between levels
- Write up skill differences between levels
- Iterate, get feedback
- Use

Strive to align with industry - shouldn't use wildly different role names, it has to sort of align with other company expectations. I've tried to shoot upwards - meaning that if you were a senior in my team, that would be senior in 90%+ of other companies too.


Work for design team - aligned across org.


Team vision - Embed T-shapedness. Work from team vision - ladder has to fit current org structure. Reward desired things.

Differences creation - General progession: increase impact (self, team, org, company, industry), increase scope (artifact, feature, flow, journey), way of working (follow rules, iterate on methods, innovate on methods, break rules. )


Followup Share tips on how to foster this culture, such as providing regular feedback and coaching, offering opportunities for professional development, and encouraging experimentation and exploration
Explain how leaders can support the career progression of their team members, such as by advocating for their advancement and providing opportunities for growth and development
Discuss the role of mentorship and coaching in supporting career progression




### ü•§ To recap
- Ladders provide clarity for progression, how the team intends to do things, what skills are missing.
- Process
- Additional materials help make actionable
- Make sure this is not in isolation - aligned with other teams (engineering, product) if tight collaboration is expected, also to HR (other ladders) also to company values.
- Leaders to help in coaching team members, make expectations clearer, better career discussions.

# üç™ Things to snack on

A great resource to get inspiration from is **[https://progression.fyi/](https://progression.fyi/)**. There are a bunch of role descriptions, templates, and frameworks to either learn from or get started with. These also offer a rare peak into these companies' design culture, as what gets highlighted in these descriptions also relates to what the teams value and understand as key in to their mission.

**Mia Blume** writes about how levels broadly support the design team in **[Developing levels on a design team](https://blog.designdept.co/developing-levels-on-a-design-team-5f8df0e462b8)**. One of the important points is that the ladder doesn't need to be a star-destroyer level thing, a simple one pager with a mission and key concepts to get the team there is already a good first step. She also gives some other good tips and principles on preparing such a document.

A cool case study from the Figma team by **Sara Culver** is **[How the Figma design team level set on career¬†leveling](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-design-team-career-levels/)** (with bonus [FigJam template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1220482745322443565) and [Skill Chart widget](https://www.figma.com/community/widget/1207836110040407856/Skills-Chart)). Their process started from the need to define what craft means for them (a central question for most design teams), which was part of the existing ladder description. The iterative process they did to get to a place where the ladder is part of the regular career conversations is especially nice.

**[Levelling up the Design Org](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/levelling-up-the-design-org-b52f9e5080a)** is a great case study by **Matthew Godfrey** about iterating on their design ladder. There is always a trade-of on how much guidance the ladder provides (on how to grow) vs how simple is it understand and apply - there is a good example here on how they've iterated on it.

While having a ladder as a general concept is easy to enough to understand, the real struggle is to define the key differences between levels, to highlight the changing expectations and progression. I found **[Taking your product design career to the next level](https://www.intercom.com/blog/product-designer-career/)** by **Paul Murphy** of Intercom a very useful resource to chart these differences, what more senior team members on higher levels should focus on. The article shows the recipe for growth as a designer as Behaviors x Results = Performance. Also, seven behaviors are listed: Be goal-oriented, Optimize for continuous progression, Be organized, Be an opportunist, Be a communicator, Be a collaborator, and Live your values.

Researchers are sometimes an afterthought when design orgs define their career ladder, so **[How to Level Up Your User Research Career](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/user-research-career-growth)** by **Nikki Anderson** is useful to get a head start. The article explains a level structure for researchers (starting with research coordinator up until head of research) according to the operational, organizational, and strategic impact they have on the company. I found the included skill descriptions as a quite good basis for customizing to a larger org's needs. Finally there are also a few tips for researchers on leveling up.

Leadership roles in design might be even more confusing than contributor job titles, and in a lot of organizations they depend on the wider definitions. Still, it's worth understanding how one's director title relates to a wider landscape, and **Matthew Diamanti**'s framework in **[Demystifying Design Leadership Levels](https://blog.prototypr.io/demystifying-design-leadership-levels-64b25bbaea7e)** helps in this. It describes the different levels as a function of behavior, and on what the role focuses on (who, what, how, why). The roles on different levels also should be clear what activities they are concentrating on (relating more to the "real" level, independently of the exact title).
