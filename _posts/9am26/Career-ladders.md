# ‚òï Career ladders

Some of the toughest conversations I've had with my reports were around promotion and growth. This makes sense, as we hire people for growth, to be able to improve and increase their impact over time, which results in the need of clarity on how growth should happen that aligns with the overall goals of the company.

My challenge was that while as a leader I could easily see why certain team members were not on a senior level yet, it was hard to articulate why exactly. Especially as this needed to be articulated across the team to make sure things are fair for all designers. Plus there is a delicate balance between giving a checklist of things to be done and describing how behaving like a senior is more than sum of tasks. 

Clearly articulating what is expected across roles and levels needs a common basis and strong vision, this is where having a career ladder helps.

Career ladders (sometimes called progression frameworks) are a description what is expected for each role in the team at each level (associate,mid, senior etc.) and provide general guidance on what is the desired growth path for team members at the organization or company. Having the expectations in writing forces clarity into otherwise vague career and promotion discussions. 

Career ladders are also closely related to skill maps - a way of describing what specific skills are desired to the work the team needs to do. Having an understanding of the teams capabilities helps in planning of who does what and also helps in hiring new members that expand the team with new skills and not just with additional hands.

Career ladders do more than inform team member's growth and promotion paths, they also help in job descriptions and  in the hiring process, they describe what are the important activities for team members, and how the designers fit into the outcomes the org aims to deliver. They are also a way to bring the vision for the design team to life - if the leader aims for designers to increase their impact, the career ladder can clarify this to team members, expanding what the team would be capable of. Plus, career ladders are key to create a culture of growth and development within the design team.

This first versions of a career ladder usually comes up once there are a few members of the team and question emerge around how to increase the impact, how the designers should grow to support business goals, and specifically how promotions should happen in the teams. At this point a short description might be enough, but as team grows, the career ladder should also evolve. 

These are the steps I've used recently to create a more detailed career ladder:
1. *Align with HR / People team.* They are generally the best partners when it comes to people questions. There might be already frameworks in place to align with, and they can help to align career ladder to the promotion process and compensation policy.
2. *Set goals.* It's a good idea to have clarity with the team what the career ladder should achieve, and how it fits with the team's vision, mission and goals. Workshops and discussions help here.
3. *Analyze company values and business goals.* Career ladder should support business goals and align with the organization's values.
4. *Architect skills.* Collect an inventory of desired behaviors, competencies, activities for team members and group them into skill groups that will help working with the ladder. This is where I got skills like "UI design" and "Communication". This was the messiest steps as team vision needed to be blended with wide range of brainstormed and desired behaviors from team members and stakeholders.
5. *Articulate role level differences.* There should be clear difference between a mid level and senior designer both in skills and expectations, but the difference shouldn't be insurmountable, and just as people's growth the progression shouldn't be linear, but exponential. This also needs to be pragmatic, while having seniors is generally desirable, the org might not need multiple lead or staff designers. Career ladders should be both aspirational and realistic. 
6. *Write up skill differences between levels.* For each level, the skills should be detailed to form the meat of the ladder, to describe how progression looks like.
7. *Iterate, get feedback, finalize.* Similar to all design projects, feedback is desirable and iterations will be needed. Team members should have the chance to ask questions to make each sentence clearer. While career ladders should get better over time, once they are finalized, they should remain relatively stable to be useful as a growth guidance.
8. *Launch and use.*

A useful tip is to try to align with the rest of the industry. For most companies, using weird roles names and different expectations for roles will have a negative effect on hiring (not getting the right people for certain role names) and retention (team members will look for roles at other companies if they see their skills misaligned with roles titles at other teams). In the past I've tried to shoot upwards meaning that if you were a senior in my team, that would be senior in 90%+ of other companies too. This can be adjusted based on how one's company compares to the broader market.




Team vision - Embed T-shapedness. Work from team vision - ladder has to fit current org structure. Reward desired things.

Differences creation - General progession: increase impact (self, team, org, company, industry), increase scope (artifact, feature, flow, journey), way of working (follow rules, iterate on methods, innovate on methods, break rules. )

Followup Share tips on how to foster this culture, such as providing regular feedback and coaching, offering opportunities for professional development, and encouraging experimentation and exploration
Explain how leaders can support the career progression of their team members, such as by advocating for their advancement and providing opportunities for growth and development

### ü•§ To recap
- Ladders provide clarity for progression, how the team intends to do things, what skills are missing.
- Process
- Additional materials help make actionable
- Make sure this is not in isolation - aligned with other teams (engineering, product) if tight collaboration is expected, also to HR (other ladders) also to company values.
- Leaders to help in coaching team members, make expectations clearer, better career discussions.

# üç™ Things to snack on

A great resource to get inspiration from is **[https://progression.fyi/](https://progression.fyi/)**. There are a bunch of role descriptions, templates, and frameworks to either learn from or get started with. These also offer a rare peak into these companies' design culture, as what gets highlighted in these descriptions also relates to what the teams value and understand as key in to their mission.

**Mia Blume** writes about how levels broadly support the design team in **[Developing levels on a design team](https://blog.designdept.co/developing-levels-on-a-design-team-5f8df0e462b8)**. One of the important points is that the ladder doesn't need to be a star-destroyer level thing, a simple one pager with a mission and key concepts to get the team there is already a good first step. She also gives some other good tips and principles on preparing such a document.

A cool case study from the Figma team by **Sara Culver** is **[How the Figma design team level set on career¬†leveling](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-design-team-career-levels/)** (with bonus [FigJam template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1220482745322443565) and [Skill Chart widget](https://www.figma.com/community/widget/1207836110040407856/Skills-Chart)). Their process started from the need to define what craft means for them (a central question for most design teams), which was part of the existing ladder description. The iterative process they did to get to a place where the ladder is part of the regular career conversations is especially nice.

**[Levelling up the Design Org](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/levelling-up-the-design-org-b52f9e5080a)** is a great case study by **Matthew Godfrey** about iterating on their design ladder. There is always a trade-of on how much guidance the ladder provides (on how to grow) vs how simple is it understand and apply - there is a good example here on how they've iterated on it.

While having a ladder as a general concept is easy to enough to understand, the real struggle is to define the key differences between levels, to highlight the changing expectations and progression. I found **[Taking your product design career to the next level](https://www.intercom.com/blog/product-designer-career/)** by **Paul Murphy** of Intercom a very useful resource to chart these differences, what more senior team members on higher levels should focus on. The article shows the recipe for growth as a designer as Behaviors x Results = Performance. Also, seven behaviors are listed: Be goal-oriented, Optimize for continuous progression, Be organized, Be an opportunist, Be a communicator, Be a collaborator, and Live your values.

Researchers are sometimes an afterthought when design orgs define their career ladder, so **[How to Level Up Your User Research Career](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/user-research-career-growth)** by **Nikki Anderson** is useful to get a head start. The article explains a level structure for researchers (starting with research coordinator up until head of research) according to the operational, organizational, and strategic impact they have on the company. I found the included skill descriptions as a quite good basis for customizing to a larger org's needs. Finally there are also a few tips for researchers on leveling up.

Leadership roles in design might be even more confusing than contributor job titles, and in a lot of organizations they depend on the wider definitions. Still, it's worth understanding how one's director title relates to a wider landscape, and **Matthew Diamanti**'s framework in **[Demystifying Design Leadership Levels](https://blog.prototypr.io/demystifying-design-leadership-levels-64b25bbaea7e)** helps in this. It describes the different levels as a function of behavior, and on what the role focuses on (who, what, how, why). The roles on different levels also should be clear what activities they are concentrating on (relating more to the "real" level, independently of the exact title).
