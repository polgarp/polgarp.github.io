# ‚òï Career ladders

Some of the toughest conversations I had with my reports were around promotion and growth. While I could easily see why certain team members were not on a senior level yet, it was hard to articulate why exactly without this getting to be a sort of checklist of things to be done. This is where having a ladder helps.

sometimes called progression frameworks, as intends to solve problems around growth. But another role is laying out team skills and making it clearer what is it that he team is doing. As with everything, writing things down forces clarity into a the otherwise vague discussions.

General progession: increase impact (self, team, org, company, industry), increase scope (artifact, feature, flow, journey), way of working (follow rules, iterate on methods, innovate on methods, break rules. )

Once there 3-4 designers and progression, promotion gets to be a quesiton, this gets brought up.

Embed T-shapedness.

Also helps checking what's missing from the team - in terms of skills.

Informs hiring and helps to understand team members how they can grow their career within the organization.

Work from team vision - ladder has to fit current org structure. Reward desired things.

Strive to align with industry - shouldn't use wildly different role names, it has to sort of align with other company expectations. I've tried to shoot upwards - meaning that if you were a senior in my team, that would be senior in 90%+ of other companies too.

Process:
- Align with HR / people team. They are experts, maybe there is something to align with. Get clear on how promotion works and how this all aligns with compensation.
- What's the need 
- Research company values and skills needed
- Group and architech skills
- Articulate high level differences between levels
- Write up skill differences between levels
- Iterate, get feedback
- Use

### ü•§ To recap
- Ladders provide clarity for progression, how the team intends to do things, what skills are missing.
- Process
- Additional materials help make actionable
- Make sure this is not in isolation - aligned with other teams (engineering, product) if tight collaboration is expected, also to HR (other ladders) also to company values.
- Leaders to help in coaching team members, make expectations clearer, better career discussions.

# üç™ Things to snack on

A great resource to get inspiration from is **[https://progression.fyi/](https://progression.fyi/)**. There are a bunch of role descriptions, templates, and frameworks to either learn from or get started with. These also offer a rare peak into these companies' design culture, as what gets highlighted in these descriptions also relates to what the teams value and understand as key in to their mission.

**Mia Blume** writes about how levels broadly support the design team in **[Developing levels on a design team](https://blog.designdept.co/developing-levels-on-a-design-team-5f8df0e462b8)**. One of the important points is that the ladder doesn't need to be a star-destroyer level thing, a simple one pager with a mission and key concepts to get the team there is already a good first step. She also gives some other good tips and principles on preparing such a document.

**[Levelling up the Design Org](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/levelling-up-the-design-org-b52f9e5080a)** is a great case study by **Matthew Godfrey** about iterating on their design ladder. There is always a trade-of on how much guidance the ladder provides (on how to grow) vs how simple is it understand and apply - this is a great example here on how they've iterated on it.

While having a ladder as a general concept is easy to enough to understand, the real struggle is to define the key differences between levels. to highlight the changing expectations and progression. I found **[Taking your product design career to the next level](https://www.intercom.com/blog/product-designer-career/)** by **Paul Murphy** of Intercom a very useful resources to chart these differences, what higher levels for more senior team members should focus on. The article shows the recipe for growth as a designer as Behaviors x Results = Performance. Also seven behaviors are listed: Be goal-oriented, Optimize for continuous progression, Be organized, Be an opportunist, Be a communicator, Be a collaborator, and Live your values.

Researchers are sometimes and afterthought when design orgs define their career ladder, so **[How to Level Up Your User Research Career](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/user-research-career-growth)** by **Nikki Anderson** is useful to get a head start. The article explains a level structure for researchers (starting with research coordinator up until head of research) according to the operational, organizational, and strategic impact they have on the company. I found the included skill descriptions as a quite good basis for customizing to the larger org's needs. Finally there are also a few tips for researchers on leveling up.

Leadership roles in design might be even more confusing than contributor job titles, and in a lot of organizations they depend on the wider definitions. Still, it's worth understanding how one's director title relates to a wider landscape, and **Matthew Diamanti**'s framework in **[Demystifying Design Leadership Levels](https://blog.prototypr.io/demystifying-design-leadership-levels-64b25bbaea7e)** helps in this. It describes the different levels as a function of behavior, on what the role focuses on (who, what, how, why). The roles on different levels also should be clear what activities they are focusing on (relating more to the "real" level, independently of the exact title).
