There are different ways to conduct a design audit, depending on the scope, objectives, and resources of the project. Here are some common methods and techniques for conducting a design audit:

1.  Heuristic evaluation: In this method, a group of designers or usability experts evaluates the design based on a set of principles or guidelines, such as Nielsen's heuristics or ISO standards. They identify usability issues, design flaws, and opportunities for improvement and rate them based on severity and frequency.
    
2.  User testing: This method involves recruiting users to test the existing design and provide feedback on its usability, effectiveness, and satisfaction. User testing can be conducted in-person or remotely, using various techniques such as moderated or unmoderated sessions, surveys, or heat maps.
    
3.  Analytics review: This method involves analyzing the quantitative data from the website or software, such as traffic, conversion rates, bounce rates, or click-through rates. It helps identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that could indicate usability or design issues.
    
4.  Content review: This method involves analyzing the quality, relevance, and consistency of the content on the website or software, such as text, images, videos, or audio. It helps ensure that the content aligns with the user's needs and expectations and supports the overall user experience.
    
5.  Design system audit: This method involves evaluating the consistency, accessibility, and scalability of the design system used in the website or software. It helps ensure that the design elements, patterns, and components follow the same standards and principles and can be easily maintained and updated.
    
6.  Competitive analysis: This method involves researching and analyzing the design of the competitors in the same industry or market. It helps identify best practices, trends, and opportunities for differentiation and innovation.
