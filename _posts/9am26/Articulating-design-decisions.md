# ‚òï  Articulating design decisions

One of the most important duties I have as a design leader to make sure the design team is highly intentional in their work. This means every interaction, every word and every pixel should have a clear reason to exist the way it does. Since product will be the result of collaboration and more often than not shared to a wider audience of stakeholders, these reasons need to be well described. That is, the design decisions need to be well articulated.

Well articulated design decisions should stand on solid ground. I've introduced some of the topics to make this happen in the last few newsletter issues. Having a shared understanding in the org what [good desgin]({% post_url 2023-02-06-What-is-good-design %}) looks like sets up ways on how to evaluate if a design decision is right. Defining [design principles]({% post_url 2023-02-12-Design-principles-set-the-foundation-for-good-design %}) creates a foundation for making choices and accepting trade-offs. Stating a clear [design intent]({% post_url 2023-02-20-Design-intent-describes-what-the-we-set-out-to-achieve %}) sets the context and aim for the design decision. These three help in developing a solid rationale.

As you get more senior, you should better understand why you do things. Team leads should help and make connections.
designers have the confidence in their rationale.

Key to be a confident designer is to be able to rationalize your decisions. Some of the problems come from not being confident enough, taking feedback as a must act on (a lot of time they are more like ideas, and need to be treated like that). 

A lot of happens when designs get out of product teams - on presentations to stakeholders or the wider org, this is where defending decisions comes up. But either way, articulation is the first step, why something is made in a certain way.

The point is, the designer should actively decide things, not passively accept for example a button being at the wrong place as there was no better way placing it.


Macro level - micro level decisions.

Decide - divergent and convergent - these help in developing an idea. This doesn't need to be a lengthy process, for example when deciding where to put that button, divergence: what do want to do and why? what are the options (for example fitting with rest of the app)? converges to a decision (button should be in top right corner) and gives a one sentence rationale that can be shared.

One reason for articulating design decisions is the role it plays in making organizations more design focused and more user-centered.

# üç™ Things to snack on

**Dan Saffer** raises a few important points in **[What is a Design Decision?](https://odannyboy.medium.com/what-is-a-design-decision-21fb7fb17089)** about what's a design decision and what's not. A lot of the decisions affecting the product are not design decisions, and are better understood as constraints to be considered in the design work.

**Chris Lee** provides a simple, two-step approach to make design decisions in **[A framework to make great design decisions](https://uxdesign.cc/a-framework-to-make-great-design-decisions-ce4a366bf3e1)**. The first step is to look at first principles, that is to think about whys and the intention. The second step is to look at the expected outcome and potential risk for directions to take. The article also gives a good example to illustrate this process.

Confidence is key to articulate decisions, and it can be increased by working on the narrative in our heads, as **Linda Eliasen** writes in **[Finding confidence in design decisions](https://www.figma.com/blog/finding-confidence-in-design-decisions/)**. The article describes two activities (Early Scary Things and Building Confidence with Data and Experience) that can be done alone or in a group to build confidence.

A huge part of articulation is presenting design solutions, and there is not better resource for that, than the **[Articulating Design Decisions](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/articulating-design-decisions/9781491921555/)** book by **Tom Greever**. It provides plenty of guidance on the whys and hows, and is also generally a good resource for stakeholder management. 

When presenting design solutions, it often comes down to deflect some of the feedback. There are a few ways of doing this as **Chris Kiess** describes in **[Defending UX design decisions ‚Äî 8 essential techniques](http://chriskiess.net/defending-ux-design-decisions-8-essential-techniques/)**.
