# ☕


When I was painting, we had this practice.

I feel this applies to all creative and also life.

Also looking at screens from a journey perspective

But professionally it's sometimes hard to see what back would be, digital stuff are too close.


Some exercises that steps you away:
- Getting feedback
- Walking throough design process with somone else
- Physical activity
- Change context (work from cafe)
- Stand up and look at your monitor from a different angle. Zoom in, zoom out
