# ☕ Ways of inquiry

Designers have multiple tools to explore the possible, but I often feel we are too stuck with a process recepie to realize how different ways help in different situations  

The messy middle of the design process often doesn't lend itself to a nice flow of steps, it's a rather confusing back and forth, so designers might fall into the trap of either overthinking user research or overthinking detailed design, while spending too little time on understanding the choices to be made.

I like to think about this as different ways of inquiry
That is, we don't inquiry the problem space and the solution space the right way.

Problem space - mostly asking research questions, but also

Solution space - building stuff, you can't grow your knowledge by asking. This means designing, or more specifically building things like visions, prototypes, experiences. 

Also asking questions in one space informs the other space - why separating research and design sharply does make little sense. Our understanding of of the problem space will be limited by not understanding how ideas gained can be expressed in the solution space.
