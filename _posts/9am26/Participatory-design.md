# ‚òï Participatory design

Often describe role as facilitating or driving. Simply, since designers on hand pdon't have all the info (at the minimum product managers know more about the business, engineers about our current system and users about their own workflow), and in general genious design is a myth.

In many ways the ideals of participatory design fused into modern UX appraoches,
But the challange remains how to involve others in our process, so it's worth taking a deeper look how to enable participation.

So facilitating beyond the design team, beyond the product team, beyond the company and beyond the users. 

There is a balance to be kept here, while going beyond the design team is table stakes, beyond the product team (like raching out to other orgs) brings more difficulty, might need more experience and knowle4dge of the political landscape to handle, while bringing in users might be challanging logistics and going beyond is rarely understood as valuebe - but something we as designers should do more often ot understand the impact of our design work.


This is also a great strategy to make our approach more user centered

Som frame participatory design as a way to do user research - which is wrong, it's an approch to design. If design without purpose is art, design without users is just rehearsal.

Workshops!

But problem is also how other disciplines are not trained in design and even after years of workin on software problems and with designers might not have language to articulate design rationale.

But this is where facilitation comes in, ask the right way, interpret and let it enrich your creative process.

# üç™ Things to snack on

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅÉ d</p>

[**Participatory design: Everything you need to know about it and how to use it**](https://pointjupiter.com/what-is-participatory-design-what-makes-it-great/) by **Ines Aniƒá** and **Vibor Cipan** is a good overview on the topic and has a lot of useful tips on how to include users into the process, including detailed steps to run such a session.

**Maddie Brown**'s article, [**How and Why to Include Users in UX Workshops**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/including-users-workshops/) shows how users can be invited into already established types of workshops the design team most probably is already doing. Having users in critical parts of the design process, such as a design studio or critique ensures the focus remains on the users.

Participation can be a useful tool in research too. **Nikki Anderson** writes about this in [**Come Together: Reasons to Include Participatory Design in Your Research Process**](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/participatory-design), starting with matching participatory research to the right research goals (creating journeys, understanding emotional responses, connections, and exploring concepts). The article has tips for each of these, with some additional notes on how to prepare for these sessions.

A mix between user research and visioning, [**Envision Future Products with Participatory Visioning Research**](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/participatory-visioning-research) by **Jaclyn Suzuki** is an interesting method. Usually research, so direct user input precedes the visioning activities, as a vision is as much internal looking as it's forward-looking. Involving users in later parts of the process might shift this focus more on to users. 

Loved the detailed walkthrough on doing a participatory design workshop by **Jennifer Davidson**, **Meridel Walkington**, **Emanuela Damiani** and **Philip Walmsley**, [**Reflections on a co-design workshop**](https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2019/01/reflections-on-a-co-design-workshop/). Things like participant selection, working with them before and after the workshop, or establishing ground rules and roles, are all important learnings that are also useful to do for less diverse sessions. 

Four cool short case studies with some method details how things were done in [**Participatory Design in Practice**](https://uxmag.com/articles/participatory-design-in-practice) by **Olga Elizarova** and **Kimberly Dowd**.
