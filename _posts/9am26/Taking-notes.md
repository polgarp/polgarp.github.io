Note taking in the strategic level means more what the team can get out of a session or study. It needs to be deliberate for long lasting and precise learnings.

Ofcourse tools like Dovetail help in note taking, but doesn't remove the need of interpreting what we hear from participants.

Type of notes are also impacted by the type of session. 

When observers take notes as they should, they need guidance and pointers. At one point I tried using empathy maps as note taking templates.

When you take notes, you are not focusing on the participant or facilitating the session. Or the other way around if you are focusing on the participant, you are not taking notes. Transcripts might help, but they are not efficient, and there is a tendency of adding a lot of of verbatim quotes instead of analysis.  

# üç™ Things to snack on

In **[Data collecting: Tips and tricks for taking notes](https://danachisnell.com/data-collecting-tips-and-tricks-for-taking-notes/)** Dana Chisnell argues that taking verbatim notes is never a good idea - transcripts are better for that. Note taking should be aligned with research questions, and it's always a good idea to ask observers and even participants to take notes for the researcher - who should be focused on leading the session.
