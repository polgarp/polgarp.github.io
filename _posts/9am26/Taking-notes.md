Note taking in the strategic level means more what the team can get out of a session or study. It needs to be deliberate for long lasting and precise learnings.

Ofcourse tools like Dovetail help in note taking, but doesn't remove the need of interpreting what we hear from participants.

Type of notes are also impacted by the type of session.

When observers take notes as they should, they need guidance and pointers. At one point I tried using empathy maps as note taking templates.

When you take notes, you are not focusing on the participant or facilitating the session. Or the other way around if you are focusing on the participant, you are not taking notes. Transcripts might help, but they are not efficient, and there is a tendency of adding a lot of of verbatim quotes instead of analysis.  

# üç™ Things to snack on

I love the approach of Will Myddelton, using **[What, So What, Now What?](https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/what-so-what-now-what)** to structure notes. This gives a good differentiation between facts, our interpretation of said facts and what it means, making notes more actionable. This approach also seems to help non-researchers to take better notes, as they are clearer what they need to look out for.

In **[Data collecting: Tips and tricks for taking notes](https://danachisnell.com/data-collecting-tips-and-tricks-for-taking-notes/)** Dana Chisnell argues that taking verbatim notes is never a good idea - transcripts are better for that. Note taking should be aligned with research questions, and it's always a good idea to ask observers and even participants to take notes for the researcher - who should be focused on leading the session.

Arnav Kumar talks about the importance of taking structured notes in **[A step-by-step guide to user research note taking](https://uxplanet.org/a-step-by-step-guide-to-user-research-note-taking-47e3184f7654)**. Structure comes not only from the notes themself, the interviewer should understand the needed strucutre by preparing from the topic, actively working toward the strucutre with active listening and during note review. Note guides can also use note taking frameworks, such as AEIOU (Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, and Users) and POEMS (People, Objects, Environments, Messages, and Services).

If there are multiple observers, it becomes **[Group Notetaking for User Research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/group-notetaking/)**. Susan Farrell describes two ways of capturing notes (chronological and topical), gives some pointers on how to choose between them. She also describes how to debrief after each session to collect insights, giving structure to notes in a mini workshop that also helps the observers to think about what they just saw.
