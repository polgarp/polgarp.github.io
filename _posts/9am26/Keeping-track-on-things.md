# üç™ Things to snack on

A great source about this topic is Julia Evans' **[Get your work recognized: write a brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)**. She writes about how her "brag docs" help in performance reviews as the key use, as it helps remembering all the things that has happened. Reviewing the brag doc also supports reflections and future career development. Since writing or at least getting started to write it is sometimes difficult, her ideas of workshop to write and review together as a team seems very useful.

Collecting evidence is also the key when applying to new jobs, as Jessica Ivins writes in **[An Essential Tool for Capturing Your Career Accomplishments](https://alistapart.com/article/the-career-management-document/)**. She recommends to not only detail accomplishments, but also include portfolio items - often a screenshot is enough. Think not only pictures of UIs and flows, but also things like Slack or LinkedIn screenshots that offer praise.

I love the enthusiasm coming from Aashni Shah's take in **[Hype Yourself! You're Worth It!](https://aashni.me/blog/hype-yourself-youre-worth-it/)**. This might come from the name "hype" - might help people to feel the logging of achievements less of a chore. The positive vibe might also help in boosting one's confidence.

David Huong also uses the term "hype doc" in **[Your Career Hype Doc](https://www.proofofconcept.pub/p/your-career-hype-doc)**. He adds more forward looking elements to the list, having mid and long term goals at the same place. Another good idea to try is how he automates the logging of hype moments as they happen instead of doing a weekly review.

Sarah Doody focuses on the documentation aspect and gives more detailed pointers on what to write on in **[Seriously, you need to start documenting your UX work](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/document-your-ux-work/)**. While she writes about projects (and how logging supports creating portfolio items), the same question prompts can go into the brag doc. Her questions are also similar to what's usually asked on portfolio reviews:

- What worked well in the project?
- In hindsight, what would you do differently?
- If you‚Äôd had more time, what would you have done?
- If you‚Äôd had more budget, what would you have done?
- What data do you have to quantify the results of the project?
- What quotes from stakeholders or users can you include to qualify the project outcome?
