# ‚òï Nonviolent communication for designers

When I started to move into more senior roles, and first became a manager, I found that I had more and more difficult discussions both within my team and with cross-functional partners. It was around that time that I learned about nonviolent communication (NVC), and it proved to be both an enormous help. I kept on practicing since, and it's a framework that every designer could benefit learning about as they get more senior.

There is a reason why communication skills are important to designers. If a designer wants to have any hope of influencing their destiny and more broadly the products they are working on, being a leader is essential, and to be an effective leader, communicating the right way is a must.

While design in a narrower sense is about making decisions while predicting the future, performing the design tasks is just a small part. To create a product, many other people need to collaborate, and that's where driving other people's decisions and establishing consensus becomes more critical. This is a major use of communication skills.

Everyone likes to work on important problems with passionate people. I'd even argue, that designers should strive to work on such problems, and enable their partners to be passionate. But passion and just the daily realities of product development make perceived differences between opinions seemingly more difficult to reconcile. So we need to make sure to talk to people empathetically while looking out for our own needs too.

This is where NVC can help and elevate our communication game a lot. It can help us to be better communicators and collaborators (and sometimes better persons too), and that also make us better designers.

I also like to talk about NVC because of the endemic issue of burnout in our industry. While there are many different reasons for it, designers should be using their empathy skills more on themselves, and be clearer about their needs. This can lead to less situations where designers need to make compromises they are not comfortable to do, and NVC provedis a good framework for this.

NVC at it's core is quite simple. 



‚Äì specific ways it's helpful

Since it focuses so much on listening, easy to see the parallels with this way of communicationg and design. 

A great way to practice when performing a critique.

I found NVC also quite helpful when thinking about the design process itself. First it disconnects observations with our own stories. Also, design process should a heart. As we explore the solution space based on what we learned, figuring out what we need from the design, how our needs as desiogn professionals are fulfilled lead to better products and a better life.

# üç™ Things to snack on

Targeted more towards managers, **Dave Bailey** wrote a good summary of nonviolent communication in [**How to Deliver Constructive Feedback in Difficult Situations**](https://medium.dave-bailey.com/the-essential-guide-to-difficult-conversations-41f736e63ccf), that goes through the basic concepts and has plenty of examples. Besides the basic patterns, there are four key points highlighted: Observations vs. evaluations, Emotions vs. thoughts, Universal needs vs. strategies, and Requests vs. demands.

[**Nonviolent Communication Training Course**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNVcESwoWu4lI9C3bhkYIWB8-dphbzJ3) is a complete training by **Marshall Rosenberg**, the original developer for this framework. While 9 hours of training videos might seem long, it's a great deep dive.

[**Approaching Nonviolent Communication in Design**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/approaching-nonviolent-communication-design-matthew-deville/) has some nice guidelines on practicing nonviolent communication, especially when giving feedback by **Matthew DeVille**. The more useful tips I found here is the "Practice self-empathy", something that can also help with the endemic burnout in our industry.

Active listening is a key part for designers to practice in design research, as **Sanna Rau** writes in [**Design and non-violent communication: how to listen**](https://uxdesign.cc/most-good-designers-have-two-ears-and-only-one-mouth-a770d11d164). Along with the tools of asking questions and using silence, these are essential tools to engage with partners. Practicing non-violent communication in the design context helps for example when giving feedback, changes the norms for communication over time.
