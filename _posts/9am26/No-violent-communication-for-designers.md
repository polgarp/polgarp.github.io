# ‚òï Nonviolent communication for designers

When first became manager and started to move into more senior roles, I found that I needed to have more and more difficult discussions both within my team and with cross-functional partners. It was around that time that I learned about nonviolent communication (NVC), and it proved to be both an enormous help, and something I keep on practicing.

‚Äì why important to designers
Since I beleive all designers are leaders, have to act as leaders if they want any hope of influencing the future, what they work on, communicating the right way is essential. 
Design is about decisions, but often as much design is about communication as we drive the design process as much as we perfom design tasks ourselves.

We like to work on important problems with passionate people. But passion also makes percieved differences between opinions larger than it has to, so communication has to be efficient too.

A lot of the tips you can hear about effective feedback, like focusing on real examples instead of stories we construct have a root on NVC. 
So NVC makes us better collaborators (and sometimes better persons too), but can also make us better designers.

I talk about this, since I see all the burnt out designers, and this is one way it can be helpful.

‚Äì specific ways it's helpful

Since it focuses so much on listening, easy to see the parallels with this way of communicationg and design. 

A great way to practice when performing a critique.

I found NVC also quite helpful when thinking about the design process itself. First it disconnects observations with our own stories. Also, design process should a heart. As we explore the solution space based on what we learned, figuring out what we need from the design, how our needs as desiogn professionals are fulfilled lead to better products and a better life.

# üç™ Things to snack on

Targeted more towards managers, **Dave Bailey** wrote a good summary of nonviolent communication in [**How to Deliver Constructive Feedback in Difficult Situations**](https://medium.dave-bailey.com/the-essential-guide-to-difficult-conversations-41f736e63ccf), that goes through the basic concepts and has plenty of examples. Besides the basic patterns, there are four key points highlighted: Observations vs. evaluations, Emotions vs. thoughts, Universal needs vs. strategies, and Requests vs. demands.

[**Nonviolent Communication Training Course**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNVcESwoWu4lI9C3bhkYIWB8-dphbzJ3) is a complete training by **Marshall Rosenberg**, the original developer for this framework. While 9 hours of training videos might seem long, it's a great deep dive.

[**Approaching Nonviolent Communication in Design**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/approaching-nonviolent-communication-design-matthew-deville/) has some nice guidelines on practicing nonviolent communication, especially when giving feedback by **Matthew DeVille**. The more useful tips I found here is the "Practice self-empathy", something that can also help with the endemic burnout in our industry.

Active listening is a key part for designers to practice in design research, as **Sanna Rau** writes in [**Design and non-violent communication: how to listen**](https://uxdesign.cc/most-good-designers-have-two-ears-and-only-one-mouth-a770d11d164). Along with the tools of asking questions and using silence, these are essential tools to engage with partners. Practicing non-violent communication in the design context helps for example when giving feedback, changes the norms for communication over time.
