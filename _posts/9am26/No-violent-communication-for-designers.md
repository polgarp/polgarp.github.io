# ☕ Non-violent communication for designers

We like to work on important problems with passionate people. But passion also makes percieved differences between opinions larger than it has to, so communication has to be efficient too.

Since it focuses so much on listening, easy to see the parallels with this way of communicationg and design. 

I found NVC also quite helpful when thinking about the design process itself.
