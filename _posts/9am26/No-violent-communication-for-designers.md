# ‚òï Nonviolent communication for designers

Design is about decisions, but often as much design is about communication as we drive the design process as much as we perfom design tasks ourselves.

Since I beleive all designers are leaders, have to act as leaders if they want any hope of influencing the future, what they work on, communicating the right way is essential. 

We like to work on important problems with passionate people. But passion also makes percieved differences between opinions larger than it has to, so communication has to be efficient too.

A lot of the tips you can hear about effective feedback, like focusing on real examples instead of stories we construct have a root on NVC. 

So NVC makes us better collaborators (and sometimes better persons too), but can also make us better designers.

Since it focuses so much on listening, easy to see the parallels with this way of communicationg and design. 

A great way to practice when performing a critique.


I found NVC also quite helpful when thinking about the design process itself.

# üç™ Things to snack on

Targeted more towards managers, **Dave Bailey** wrote a good summary of nonviolent communication in [**How to Deliver Constructive Feedback in Difficult Situations**](https://medium.dave-bailey.com/the-essential-guide-to-difficult-conversations-41f736e63ccf), that goes through the basic concepts and has plenty of examples. Besides the basic patterns, there are four key points highlighted: Observations vs. evaluations, Emotions vs. thoughts, Universal needs vs. strategies, and Requests vs. demands.

[**Nonviolent Communication Training Course**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNVcESwoWu4lI9C3bhkYIWB8-dphbzJ3) is a complete training by **Marshall Rosenberg**, the original developer for this framework. While 9 hours of training videos might seem long, it's a very good deep dive.

[**Approaching Nonviolent Communication in Design**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/approaching-nonviolent-communication-design-matthew-deville/) has some nice guidelines on practicing nonviolent communication, especially when giving feedback by **Matthew DeVille**. One of the more useful tips I found here is the "Practice self-empathy", something that can also help with the endemic burnout in our industry.

Active listening is a key part for designers to practice in design research, as **Sanna Rau** writes in [**Design and non-violent communication: how to listen**](https://uxdesign.cc/most-good-designers-have-two-ears-and-only-one-mouth-a770d11d164). Along with the tools of asking questions and using silence, these are essential tools to engage with partners. Practising non-violent communication in the design context helps for example when giving feedback, changes the norms for communication over time.
