# ☕ Insights to design - download and activate

(Thanks for the topic idea, Gabriele!)

Research done, now what? Often said that executing the resarch is approx 30% of the work for a researcher.

Download and activate.

The case when the research is actively part of the design process - through learning plan questions are answered, opportunities openned,.

But what if these are separate steps. Let's imagine sgakeholder's were included, analysis was done together, and insights are relevant to the work the design team is doing (and done with rigor).


So how do you download? Ideally research is continuous, integral part of the overall design process and not a separate phase (even if double diamond and design thinking describe it like that) - but certain type of research need to be happen before design, like understanding context.

Some teams are doing the opposite - design something, and research with the existing artifact as stimuli. While this can be fast, it also severly cuts the possible solution space, and might take a long time to converge.


research insights as design criteria

using stories  - compose from insights and describe criteria to design against.

Develop intuition and being data informed.


Creating roadmap, workshops to do.
