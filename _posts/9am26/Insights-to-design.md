# ‚òï Download insights into the design process

(Thanks for the topic idea, Gabriele!)

Research done, now what? Often said that executing the resarch is approx 30% of the work for a researcher.

Download and activate.

The case when the research is actively part of the design process - through learning plan questions are answered, opportunities openned,.

But what if these are separate steps. Let's imagine sgakeholder's were included, analysis was done together, and insights are relevant to the work the design team is doing (and done with rigor).


So how do you download? Ideally research is continuous, integral part of the overall design process and not a separate phase (even if double diamond and design thinking describe it like that) - but certain type of research need to be happen before design, like understanding context.

Some teams are doing the opposite - design something, and research with the existing artifact as stimuli. While this can be fast, it also severly cuts the possible solution space, and might take a long time to converge.


research insights as design criteria

using stories  - compose from insights and describe criteria to design against.

Develop intuition and being data informed.

Research done needs to fit somewhere to be able to drive decisions. 


Creating roadmap, workshops to do.

# üç™ Things to snack on

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅÉ</p>

[**From Generative Interviews to a Strategic  Roadmap with Atomic UX Research**](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/dovetail-atomic-ux-research-to-roadmap) is a nice use case from Dovetail by **Katryna Balboni** about using insights. The article explains in a straightforward way how to use atomic insights to support opportunities, but maybe the more interesting part is how detailed design also needed a clear strategy to start. 

**Nikki Anderson-Stainer** has two great articles about activating insights:
- In [**Have Research Insights Collecting Dust? Here's How to Activate Them**](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/activate-research-insight) she describes the step where insights would be used in the design process as activation. This happens after the research insights are delivered, and it's about making sure the conclusions are heard and used by the org. The article offers a few techniques for activating both within the project (involving stakeholders, using video clips, running debriefs, having brainstorming sessions, and having space for Q&A) and after the project (HMW statements, ideation workshops, and insights hackathons).
- In [**Use Ideation and Co-Creation to Supercharge Your Insights**](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/insights-activation-ideation-co-creation ) she shows two ways to work with insights in the design process. Working with insights in an ideation workshop would mean to have a clear pain point or need as the focus‚Äîas supported by insights from the research. Co-creation goes beyond the immediate team and brings also participants into the process to have the direct perspective in the process, rather just a stand-in insight. 

I lived the simple description of how to frame each step in the research output, [**From finding to doing**](https://uxdesign.cc/from-finding-to-doing-b33c0dfd9480) by **Jemma Frost**. The steps are Data, Findings, Insights, Frameworks, Opportunities and Recommendations. The article has bunch of eamples and tips for each.
