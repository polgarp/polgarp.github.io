# ‚òï Activating insights for the design process

(Thanks for the topic idea, Gabriele!)

Let's imagine you just did an awesome and beautiful generative study. The research went well, the users were great, the findings compelling. You synthesize and share the findings. So now what? How will the product team work with these findings? How to make sure the design is actually built upon the findings, that is process is evidence based?

We had this old rule of the thumb that UX research is approximately 30% doing the actual studies (so planning, recruiting, conducting sessions, analyzing, creating artifacts), 30% of time is figuring out what to do, and 30% is making sure the results are actually heard and used within the product development.

This last 30% consists of multiple activities, reframing research done, participating in team rituals such as planning to make sure insights are for followed, being generally an advocate for the user, and helping the team to work with the findings and insights produced. Helping the team to work with research results is called downloading (aiding the team to digest the results) and activation (making sure the results become part of the design process).

Ideally, most generative research would be done together with the product team. [**Product trios**]({% post_url 9am26/2023-06-26-Product-trios-for-designers %}) would do the research together (maybe with the assistance of a UX researcher), or at the very least the product designer is part of the research process from defining research questions up until synthesis. This makes activation easier, the designer would be already marinated in the user insights and is set up by the user stories heard to better understand the problem space and to generate solution ideas.

But even in these cases, members of the product team like engineers would need to have a good understanding of the users to be able to do great work. This is where activation becomes important and a key part of the planning process.
Research done needs to fit somewhere to be able to drive decisions. 

Activation not only happens after the end of the study, it's a process. 
Depending on th team balance what activites to do together. The best approach will vary depending on the specific context and needs of the team.
Develop intuition and being data informed.

Obviously for the activation to succeed research needs to answer key questions...

Sessions together need to balance and thinkg about exposure.

Analysis together ...

Reports are neccessary but not enough.‚Ä¶

Work together on findings in workshops.‚Ä¶

Outpot from research, stories can act as design criteria...
research insights as design criteria
using stories  - compose from insights and describe criteria to design against.
Creating roadmap, workshops to do.

As a design leader...

# üç™ Things to snack on

I liked the simple description of how to frame each step in generating the research output and impact, [**From finding to doing**](https://uxdesign.cc/from-finding-to-doing-b33c0dfd9480) by **Jemma Frost**. The steps are Data, Findings, Insights, Frameworks, Opportunities, and Recommendations. The article has a bunch of examples and tips for each of these. 

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅâ</p>

**Leisa Reichelt** writes about what each role is responsible for in the process of downloading research in [**From insights to actions. Or, what should we do with this research?**](https://medium.com/designing-atlassian/from-insights-to-actions-or-what-should-we-do-with-this-research-3c55489296c). Researchers should make insights actionable by describing what is happening and why it's happening, but they can't answer on their own what the team should do. Designers, product managers, engineers, and data scientist will all bring their perspective into the process to get to that.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅâ</p>

**Nikki Anderson-Stainer** has two great articles about activating insights:
- In [**Have Research Insights Collecting Dust? Here's How to Activate Them**](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/activate-research-insight) she describes the step where insights would be used in the design process as activation. This happens after the research insights are delivered, and it's about making sure the conclusions are heard and used by the org. The article offers a few techniques for activating both within the project (involving stakeholders, using video clips, running debriefs, having brainstorming sessions, and having space for Q&A) and after the project (HMW statements, ideation workshops, and insights hackathons).
- In [**Use Ideation and Co-Creation to Supercharge Your Insights**](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/insights-activation-ideation-co-creation ) she shows two ways to work with insights in the design process. Working with insights in an ideation workshop would mean to have a clear pain point or need as the focus‚Äîas supported by insights from the research. Co-creation goes beyond the immediate team and brings also participants into the process to have the direct perspective in the process, rather just a stand-in insight. 

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅâ</p>

[**Using Journey Lines: Insights and Ideation**](https://uxpamagazine.org/using-journey-lines/) by **Beverly Freeman** and **Mark Wehner** is an interesting method for both collecting stories in user sessions and brainstorm for solution afterward. In the sessions the users build a journey together with an interviewer, a visual representation, a simplified user journey of their experience. Later with the team, the same journey lines can be used as a brainstorming stimulus. The workshop members can take a look at the journey lines and should brainstorm ways to make them a better experience, thereby coming with ideas to explore.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅâ</p>

[**From Generative Interviews to a Strategic  Roadmap with Atomic UX Research**](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/dovetail-atomic-ux-research-to-roadmap) is a nice use case from Dovetail by **Katryna Balboni** about using insights. The article explains in a straightforward way how to use atomic insights to support opportunities, but maybe the more interesting part is how detailed design also needed a clear strategy to start.
