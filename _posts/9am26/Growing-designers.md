# ☕ Nurturing designer and researcher careers

Mentoring vs coaching.

Done with [**career ladder**]({% link 9am26/2023-04-03-Career-ladders-chart-a-path-for-the-teams-growth %}) now how to get people to get better, to progress in their career? Key in growing the team's influence in the company, and generally due to the fast paced nature of tech companies, product design teams can't afford to not have a growth mindset.

Build relationship. Too many bad managers.

Confidence - in embedded model especially important

Two types: targeted help - what the person needs at the moment. Professional development.
1:1s is a playground

Difference per levels:
- juniors: pair design, apprentice model, mentoring
- medior: help find voice and confidence, design critique, leading practice, coaching
- senior: taking more in their own hand, partnership, leading projects and initiatives

  GROW is a tool that is always useful to get started from. This both helps in a larger scale (career) and smaller (what to learn next). I tend to do a broader examination on what's the purpose or long-term career goals, but especially for juniors this might be harder to grasp and it's better to focus on just a few next steps.
