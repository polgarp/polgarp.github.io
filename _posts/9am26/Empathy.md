# ☕ Raising team empathy

(Thanks for the topic idea, Jakob Christoffersen!)

It's also a spicy topic, since… 

Also empathy is a collaboration super skill. Better understanding other's situation also helps to make better consensus. 

While usually design carries the torch of empathy, they might have a hard time what exactly mean. And it might be even harder to tell the other teams to articulate why it's important.

Empathy in teams (which also improves the skills) and empath as part of the design process

# 🍪 Things to snack on

**Indy Young**'s [**Practical Empathy**](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/practical-empathy/) book (also, as [**conference talk**](https://indiyoung.com/conference-presentation-practical-empathy/)) is the single best resource to learn about empathy, how to get better at it, and how to apply it. As it's an essential skills to not only for designers, this can be useful to other functions too.

Empathy is often just another vague word, **Sarah Gibbons** clarifies the depth that is useful for design in [**Sympathy vs. Empathy in UX**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/sympathy-vs-empathy-ux/). There is a bunch of useful tips empathy can be practiced in design, for example by using qualitative methods, using videos when presenting research findings, or having a diverse team.

A few nice examples to practice empathy by **Jennifer Winter** in [**Three Exercises to Teach Your Team Empathy**](https://uxbooth.com/articles/three-exercises-to-teach-your-team-empathy/). These exercises focus on learning about other people, understanding their situation and practice active listening. Similar practices can be easily added to team meetings.

**Jared Spool** writes about exposure hours in [**Fast Path to a Great UX**](https://jmspool.medium.com/fast-path-to-a-great-ux-increased-exposure-hours-afde796f2e43), which is not only a great tool to increase user-centeredness, but also helps teams develop empathy. What I really like that it also gives a simple measurement - everyone should spend two hours with users every 6 weeks, which is seems achievable for most orgs.

I liked this short one from **Dan Saffer**: [**In Design, Empathy is Not Enough**](https://odannyboy.medium.com/in-design-empathy-is-not-enough-c315b1c1ecee), as it highlights how empathy fits into the broader design process. Empathy is the preceding step for understanding - which helps in finding the solutions for the problems uncovered.

While design teams often advocate for empathy a lot, it's interesting to see how other functions take empathy seriously, like in **Zafeer Rais**'s [**The most important product manager skill: empathy**](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/product-manager-and-empathy-f7f886616ee1). Rais describes how empathy can be showcased towards users, customers, engineer & design teams, stakeholders, the company overall and yourself.

[**Empathy Prompts**](https://empathyprompts.net/) is a neat little utility that helps to experience certain disabilities.
