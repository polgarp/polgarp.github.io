# ☕ Raising team empathy

(Thanks for the topic idea, Jakob Christoffersen!)

Empathy is such a buzzword, as design teams like to think 
It's also a spicy topic, since empathy is not that well understood.

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. In the design process, empathy is essential for understanding the needs and wants of users. When designers have empathy for their users, they are better able to create products that are user-friendly, effective, and enjoyable to use.

While usually design carries the torch of empathy, they might have a hard time what exactly mean. And it might be even harder to tell the other teams to articulate why it's important.

Empathy in teams (which also improves the skills) and empath as part of the design process


It's the first step in the design thinking process, so teams adopting it as an approach could easily think they empathise with users, when in fact they only. 
  
Empathy is applied within a design process in a number of ways, but the most common steps or methods include:

1.  **User research:** This is the process of gathering information about the users of a product or service. This information can be gathered through interviews, surveys, and observation. The goal of user research is to understand the users' needs, wants, and pain points.
2.  **Personas:** Personas are fictional representations of users. They are created by combining information from user research with the designer's own insights. Personas can be used to help designers understand the users' needs and wants on a deeper level.
3.  **User journey mapping:** User journey mapping is a way of understanding the user's experience with a product or service. It involves mapping out the steps that a user takes when interacting with a product or service. User journey mapping can help designers identify potential problems and areas for improvement.
4.  **Empathy mapping:** Empathy mapping is a technique for understanding the user's emotions and motivations. It involves creating a map of the user's thoughts, feelings, and actions at different points in their interaction with a product or service. Empathy mapping can help designers understand the user's perspective and create a more user-friendly experience.

These are just a few of the ways that empathy can be applied within a design process. Here are some additional tips for applying empathy in the design process:

* **Be open-minded:** When you are gathering information about users, be open to hearing their thoughts and feelings, even if they are different from your own.
* **Be respectful:** Remember that the user is the one who will be using your product, so it's important to treat them with respect.
* **Be willing to listen:** Be willing to listen to the user's feedback and be willing to make changes to your design based on their input.



Besides the process, It helps on multiple levels, for users, for team members. It's great to develop
Also empathy is a collaboration super skill. Better understanding other's situation also helps to make better consensus. 

Here are some tips on how a design leader can teach or help learn about empathy for product designers and other product team members:

* **Start by modeling empathy yourself.** As a design leader, you set the tone for the team. If you want your team to be empathetic, you need to be empathetic yourself. This means being able to understand and share the feelings of others, even if you don't agree with them.
* **Create opportunities for team members to learn about empathy.** There are many resources available to help people learn about empathy. You can recommend books, articles, or even workshops to your team. You can also create opportunities for team members to practice empathy by having them participate in role-playing exercises or by giving them assignments that require them to understand the perspective of others.
* **Encourage team members to share their experiences.** One of the best ways to learn about empathy is to share your own experiences and to listen to the experiences of others. Encourage team members to share their stories about times when they have been empathetic or times when they have struggled with empathy.
* **Create a culture of feedback.** A culture of feedback is essential for learning and growth. Encourage team members to give and receive feedback on their work. This will help them to become more aware of their own biases and to learn how to be more empathetic to others.

Here are some specific activities that a design leader can do to help teach or help learn about empathy for product designers and other product team members:

* **Have team members participate in a role-playing exercise where they have to take on the perspective of a user.** This will help them to understand the user's needs and pain points.
* **Have team members read a book or article about empathy.** This will help them to learn more about the concept of empathy and how to apply it in their work.
* **Have team members participate in a workshop on empathy.** This will give them the opportunity to learn from experts and to practice their empathy skills.
* **Create a team empathy charter.** This document can outline the team's commitment to empathy and can provide guidance on how to apply empathy in the workplace.

# 🍪 Things to snack on

**Indy Young**'s [**Practical Empathy**](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/practical-empathy/) book (also, as [**conference talk**](https://indiyoung.com/conference-presentation-practical-empathy/)) is the single best resource to learn about empathy, how to get better at it, and how to apply it. As it's an essential skills to not only for designers, this can be useful to other functions too.

Empathy is often just another vague word, **Sarah Gibbons** clarifies the depth that is useful for design in [**Sympathy vs. Empathy in UX**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/sympathy-vs-empathy-ux/). There is a bunch of useful tips empathy can be practiced in design, for example by using qualitative methods, using videos when presenting research findings, or having a diverse team.

<p style="text-align: center;">🁆</p>

A few nice examples to practice empathy by **Jennifer Winter** in [**Three Exercises to Teach Your Team Empathy**](https://uxbooth.com/articles/three-exercises-to-teach-your-team-empathy/). These exercises focus on learning about other people, understanding their situation and practice active listening. Similar practices can be easily added to team meetings.

**Jared Spool** writes about exposure hours in [**Fast Path to a Great UX**](https://jmspool.medium.com/fast-path-to-a-great-ux-increased-exposure-hours-afde796f2e43), which is not only a great tool to increase user-centeredness, but also helps teams develop empathy. What I really like that it also gives a simple measurement - everyone should spend two hours with users every 6 weeks, which is seems achievable for most orgs. 

<p style="text-align: center;">🁆</p>

I liked this short one from **Dan Saffer**: [**In Design, Empathy is Not Enough**](https://odannyboy.medium.com/in-design-empathy-is-not-enough-c315b1c1ecee), as it highlights how empathy fits into the broader design process. Empathy is the preceding step for understanding - which helps in finding the solutions for the problems uncovered. 

<p style="text-align: center;">🁆</p>

While design teams often advocate for empathy a lot, it's interesting to see how other functions take empathy seriously, like in **Zafeer Rais**'s [**The most important product manager skill: empathy**](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/product-manager-and-empathy-f7f886616ee1). Rais describes how empathy can be showcased towards users, customers, engineer & design teams, stakeholders, the company overall and yourself.
