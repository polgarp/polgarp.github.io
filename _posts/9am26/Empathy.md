# ☕ Raising team empathy

(Thanks for the topic idea, Jakob Christoffersen!)

Empathy has been, and remains a buzzword. Often included in job descriptions for UX, design and research related roles. As a call to the broader design industry to focus on the users. A key skill that differentiates unethical technology bros from humane designers. 

Design teams also like to describe themselves as the team advocating for users. Meaning acting with empathy is a sort of role-based competence that other functions don't have. But why couldn't we raise the empathy of others?

While it's true that empathy is important, it's often not that well understood what it exactly means. And especially how to get better at it. If a design team has the goal of making their wider organization more user-centered, they should also think about how they use empathy, and how they can teach the wider org to get better at empathy.

To advocate for more empathy, design teams also need to understand how it contributes to their design process. This helps in articulating to the other teams why it's important and how to work with it.

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. In the design process, empathy is essential for understanding the needs and wants of users. Here is where understanding gets important - just sharing feelings leads to sympathy with little actionable insights.

Teams adopting the design thinking process, sometimes just point at the first step (Empathize!) as the key point where they understand the users - usually with some user research methods. But obviously using empathy in the beginning in the process is not enough, besides the right methods the right mindset is more important.

Since we are creating products for people to be used, things should start with the users. What are their needs? What are their goals? What are their pain points? There also needs to be respect for their time and attention - both during the design process and in the products we create. Finally understanding is not a single act, feedback from users drives further iterations ti make things better.

So start with the users, respect, iterations - these need to be grounding points towards empathizing. To make this happen team members need to be open minded, respectful and willing to listen - these are qualities that are difficult to coach, but can be improved while improving a team's empathy levels.

Building on the mindset, empathy is useful in a few ways. It helps the team understanding the user's
- Goals: What are they trying to achieve? What are their motivations? 
- Pain points:  What are the things that are getting in their way?
- Context: How is their environment? What are their constraints?
- Emotions: How do they feel when they use your product? What emotions are they trying to achieve?

Within the design process empathy applies to getting a better understanding of the users, and bringing that information to energize, motivate the team and also to enable better design decisions. The most common steps or methods include:
-  User research: Gathering information about the users of a product or service through interviews, surveys, and observation etc. The goal of user research is to understand the users' needs, wants, and pain points.
-  Personas: Representations of users created by combining information from user research and other sources. Personas can be used to express and visualize users' needs and wants on a deeper level.
-  User journey mapping: Understanding the user's experience with a product by mapping out the steps that a user takes when interacting with a product. Helps to identify potential problems and areas for improvement.
-  Empathy mapping: Understanding the user's emotions and motivations by creating a map of the user's thoughts, feelings, and actions at different points in their interaction with a product or service. Empathy mapping can help designers understand the user's perspective and create a more user-friendly experience.





While design usually focuses on empathy towards the users to support the design process, for leaders the problem is more widespread, as empathy within the team and organisation is important - as it makes the collaboration easier. So raising empathy is also important to build great teams.

Besides the process, It helps on multiple levels, for users, for team members. It's great to develop
Also empathy is a collaboration super skill. Better understanding other's situation also helps to make better consensus. 

Here are some tips on how a design leader can teach or help learn about empathy for product designers and other product team members:

* **Start by modeling empathy yourself.** As a design leader, you set the tone for the team. If you want your team to be empathetic, you need to be empathetic yourself. This means being able to understand and share the feelings of others, even if you don't agree with them.
* **Create opportunities for team members to learn about empathy.** There are many resources available to help people learn about empathy. You can recommend books, articles, or even workshops to your team. You can also create opportunities for team members to practice empathy by having them participate in role-playing exercises or by giving them assignments that require them to understand the perspective of others.
* **Encourage team members to share their experiences.** One of the best ways to learn about empathy is to share your own experiences and to listen to the experiences of others. Encourage team members to share their stories about times when they have been empathetic or times when they have struggled with empathy.
* **Create a culture of feedback.** A culture of feedback is essential for learning and growth. Encourage team members to give and receive feedback on their work. This will help them to become more aware of their own biases and to learn how to be more empathetic to others.

Here are some specific activities that a design leader can do to help teach or help learn about empathy for product designers and other product team members:

* **Have team members participate in a role-playing exercise where they have to take on the perspective of a user.** This will help them to understand the user's needs and pain points.
* **Have team members read a book or article about empathy.** This will help them to learn more about the concept of empathy and how to apply it in their work.
* **Have team members participate in a workshop on empathy.** This will give them the opportunity to learn from experts and to practice their empathy skills.
* **Create a team empathy charter.** This document can outline the team's commitment to empathy and can provide guidance on how to apply empathy in the workplace.

# 🍪 Things to snack on

**Indy Young**'s [**Practical Empathy**](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/practical-empathy/) book (also, as [**conference talk**](https://indiyoung.com/conference-presentation-practical-empathy/)) is the single best resource to learn about empathy, how to get better at it, and how to apply it. As it's an essential skill not only for designers, it's a recommended read to other functions too.

<p style="text-align: center;">🁆</p>

Empathy is often just another vague word, **Sarah Gibbons** clarifies the depth that is useful for design in [**Sympathy vs. Empathy in UX**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/sympathy-vs-empathy-ux/). There is a bunch of useful tips empathy can be practiced in design, for example by using qualitative methods, using videos when presenting research findings, or having a diverse team.

<p style="text-align: center;">🁆</p>

A few nice examples to teach and practice empathy by **Jennifer Winter** in [**Three Exercises to Teach Your Team Empathy**](https://uxbooth.com/articles/three-exercises-to-teach-your-team-empathy/). These exercises focus on learning about other people, understanding their situation and practice active listening. Similar practices can be easily added to team meetings.

**Jared Spool** writes about exposure hours in [**Fast Path to a Great UX**](https://jmspool.medium.com/fast-path-to-a-great-ux-increased-exposure-hours-afde796f2e43), which is not only a great tool to increase user-centeredness, but also helps teams develop empathy. What I really like that it also gives a simple measurement - everyone should spend two hours with users every 6 weeks, which is seems achievable for most orgs. 

<p style="text-align: center;">🁆</p>

I liked this short one from **Dan Saffer**: [**In Design, Empathy is Not Enough**](https://odannyboy.medium.com/in-design-empathy-is-not-enough-c315b1c1ecee), as it highlights how empathy fits into the broader design process. Empathy is the preceding step for understanding - which helps in finding the solutions for the problems uncovered. 

<p style="text-align: center;">🁆</p>

While design teams often advocate for empathy, it's interesting to see how other functions take empathy seriously, like in **Zafeer Rais**'s [**The most important product manager skill: empathy**](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/product-manager-and-empathy-f7f886616ee1). Rais describes how empathy can be showcased towards users, customers, engineer & design teams, stakeholders, the company overall and yourself.
