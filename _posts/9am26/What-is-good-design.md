# üç™ Things to snack on

**[Good vs Great](https://www.andy.works/words/good-vs-great-design)** is an inspiring list of contrast by **Andy Works** - showing the differences between a design that designers usually aim for (such as usable or consistent) and what we could be aiming for (enriches the soul or opens new vistas). The final conclusion being that once good is achieved, designers can start thinking about great.

A lot of what we understand today as good design in product design comes from Dieter Rams, here is a write up from  **Bora**: **[# Dieter Rams and 10 principles for good design](https://uxdesign.cc/dieter-rams-and-ten-principles-for-good-design-61cc32bcd6e6)** (plus some nice Braun product imagery). Since good design is hard to define, the ten principles set what's important to consider in good design (such being innovative or honest). Even if the principles are 50 years old, they are still relevant and important today (such as being environment-friendly).


**Akos Csertan** writes about how good design is created in **[Good designers don‚Äôt make good design](https://blog.prototypr.io/good-designers-dont-make-good-design-be338b5b7f10)** with the main point that the whole company needs to be human-centered, it's not enough to throw designers at projects and expect great design output. Maybe the broader point is also that while design teams can drive the definition of what's considered good design, there also needs to be a common understanding, so the design team needs to train the rest of the organization on what good looks like.

Since we create products or humans it makes sense to consider all sorts of human capabilities even if we limit the target audience as much as possible - hence accessibility should be considered in good design, as **Sharlene King** argues in **[Good design was always accessible](https://typodactyl.medium.com/good-design-was-always-accessible-74b3a1782b09)**. Accessible design is good design since considering all sorts of people makes the experience also for everyone ese.
