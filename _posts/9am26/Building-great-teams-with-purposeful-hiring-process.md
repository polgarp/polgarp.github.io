# ‚òï  Building great teams with purposeful hiring process

Hiring is the most important job of a design leader. Prioritise it over everything else.

Treat it as a design project, get feedback from candidates, bring empathy, understand business goals, have a vision, measure impact.

Make sure you hire you want to hire - generally increase diversity of thought in the team.

Each step should have one or two key competencies it tries to validate

No homework.

reduce bias - the most important

# üç™ Things to snack on

**[Design orgs are their own greatest impediment to success in recruiting and hiring](https://www.petermerholz.com/blog/design-orgs-are-their-own-greatest-impediment-to-success-in-recruiting-and-hiring/)** by **Peter Merholz**

**[Applying UX-Workshop Techniques to the Hiring Process](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-workshops-in-hiring/)** by **Rachel Krause**

**[Lessons learnt: hiring for product design](https://medium.com/thriva/https-medium-com-thriva-lessons-learnt-hiring-for-product-design-c357b53ffb97)** by **Bryn Taylor**

**Evan Sunwall** writes specifically hiring interviews and differences between going with the flow, and making them unstructured or making them structured in **[Hiring Interviews Are Terrible: Smart UX Teams Structure Them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/structured-hiring-interviews/)**. Since hiring interviews are similar to user interviews, it makes a lot of sense spending more energy on them leads to better outcomes.

**[Redesigning our product design hiring process](https://uxdesign.cc/redesigning-our-product-design-hiring-process-de7d0ee80515)** is a great use case by **Sean Filiatrault**. From the process they've started with, the challenges for candidates sound quite widespread, as the challenges for the team (especially the negative reputation can have long term impact). 

I liked the learnings by the **Faire Design Team** in **[Designing an interview process for product designers](https://craft.faire.com/designing-an-interview-process-for-product-designers-b6ada19a957b)**. Preparing candidates with an interview guide for candidates sounds helpful to take some of the bias and stress out of the process, while training interviewers helped them to reach their hiring goals and removed some of the more subjective judgments. 

Though about engineering process, a lot of good insights in **[Develop Your Hiring System Like a Product to Eliminate Bias and Boost Retention](https://review.firstround.com/develop-your-hiring-system-like-a-product-to-eliminate-bias-and-boost-retention)**, treating the hiring process like product development. The article details how Dan Pupius applied this approach at Medium: Starting with a vision (what sort of team to build), principles (guidelines to apply to each candidate) to make decisions, tactics (how to execute the process steps), what to measure (also collecting feedback from candidates), and how to iterate.
