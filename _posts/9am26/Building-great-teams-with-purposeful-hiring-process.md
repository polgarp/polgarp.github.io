# ‚òï  Building great teams with purposeful hiring process

Hiring well is difficult, yet it's one of the highest leverage work a design leader can do. If there are missing people in the team and open headcounts, the rest of the team and the overall design output suffers. So design teams should prioritise hiring above everything else. and sometimes relegated to the side, trusting People and HR teams to do most of the work.

I've written about our hiring process  couple of years ago, right after I've learned my first few lessons (**[Hiring UX people at Emarsys](https://medium.com/emarsys-craftlab/hiring-ux-people-at-emarsys-e12f5bfdd5fb)** describes our process at Emarsys). Based a lessons I've learned since, some parts are still quite relevant - like having clear ideas about the team and how the role fits, and having principles, I also see myself re-using these when I create new processes. Some other parts however, especially within the process steps I've changed my mind considerable. So, right principles and intention but implementation that should be improved.

For design leaders who are about to hiring for a new role, it's better to create a new process or at least evaluate what worked previously. Either way, the process established by others should be viewed a critical eye. Think about the hiring process as a design project. What's already in place might be from an earlier approach, or might be not intentionally designed for hiring great researchers and designers. Either way there is room for improvement. Thinking about design process gets to use tools like understanding business goals, having a vision, bringing in empathy, iterating on the process and process details, getting feedback from candidates, and measuring impact.

Vision for roles vision for teams.

For principles
Make sure you hire you want to hire - generally increase diversity of thought in the team.
fit is the most important thing. also need to customize process for roles
reduce bias - the most important

Each step should have one or two key competencies it tries to validate

The latest generic process I've been using

Homework, most types of in person exercises (like whiteboard sessions) and trial days all suffer from the same issue. There are obviously perceived benefits to both parties, there is a deeper look into both how the candidates performs, how they approach problem etc that paints the better picture than a case study. The candidates might also get a better insight into the internal collaboration of the company. But the downsides far outweighs the benefits. Every one of these practices ask the candidates to spend time and energy on a role which is unjustified. Also breaks our principle of caring about candidates.


So how you get people in? Partnership with HR. Internal references (might reduce diversity). 
Build a passive pipeline - by writing articles, networking, speaking on meetups, participating on conferences.

# üç™ Things to snack on

A lot of great insights about issues in how design orgs do their recruitment in **[Design orgs are their own greatest impediment to success in recruiting and hiring](https://www.petermerholz.com/blog/design-orgs-are-their-own-greatest-impediment-to-success-in-recruiting-and-hiring/)** by **Peter Merholz**. The common problems the article mentions: Design teams rely too much on the HR / recruiter teams, design teams don't spend enough time on hiring, the roles to be hired are not defined well enough, the process ignores best practices (for length, preparing interviewers and having no clear assessment guidelines). The article also gives some tips and best practices for these common issues.

**[Redesigning our product design hiring process](https://uxdesign.cc/redesigning-our-product-design-hiring-process-de7d0ee80515)** is a great use case by **Sean Filiatrault**. From the process they've started with, the challenges for candidates sound quite widespread, as the challenges for the team (especially the negative reputation can have long term impact). 

I liked the learnings by the **Faire Design Team** in **[Designing an interview process for product designers](https://craft.faire.com/designing-an-interview-process-for-product-designers-b6ada19a957b)**. Preparing candidates with an interview guide for candidates sounds helpful to take some of the bias and stress out of the process, while training interviewers helped them to reach their hiring goals and removed some of the more subjective judgments. 

Though about engineering process, a lot of good insights in **[Develop Your Hiring System Like a Product to Eliminate Bias and Boost Retention](https://review.firstround.com/develop-your-hiring-system-like-a-product-to-eliminate-bias-and-boost-retention)** over at First Round Review, treating the hiring process like product development. The article details how **Dan Pupius** applied this approach at Medium: Starting with a vision (what sort of team to build), principles (guidelines to apply to each candidate) to make decisions, tactics (how to execute the process steps), what to measure (also collecting feedback from candidates), and how to iterate. 

A few good tips and tactics by **Rachel Krause** to use in **[Applying UX-Workshop Techniques to the Hiring Process](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-workshops-in-hiring/)**. As in design work, the divergence and convergence is important to reduce bias and group thinking in the process - writing feedback about candidates alone and discussing together allows for more details to emerge. Prioritization matrices are good for putting the desired competencies into relation to each other.

**Evan Sunwall** writes specifically about hiring interviews and differences between going with the flow, and making them unstructured or making them structured in **[Hiring Interviews Are Terrible: Smart UX Teams Structure Them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/structured-hiring-interviews/)**. Since hiring interviews are similar to user interviews, it makes a lot of sense that spending more energy on them leads to better outcomes.
