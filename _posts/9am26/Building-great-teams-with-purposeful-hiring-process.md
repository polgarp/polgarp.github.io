# ‚òï  Building great teams with purposeful hiring process

Hiring is difficult, and sometimes relegated to the side, trusting People and HR teams to do most of the work.

Hiring is the most important job of a design leader. Prioritise it over everything else.

I've learned a lot since I started hiring (**[Hiring UX people at Emarsys](https://medium.com/emarsys-craftlab/hiring-ux-people-at-emarsys-e12f5bfdd5fb)** describes our first process at Emarsys), wouldn't do homework or trial days any more - the perceived benefits (deeper look into candidates, better introduction about ourselves) are fare outweighed by the downsides (most importantly the amount of time investment we have asked for).

Treat it as a design project, get feedback from candidates, bring empathy, understand business goals, have a vision, measure impact.

Make sure you hire you want to hire - generally increase diversity of thought in the team.

Each step should have one or two key competencies it tries to validate



No homework.

reduce bias - the most important

Build a passive pipeline - by writing articles, networking, speaking on meetups, participating on conferences. 

The latest generic process I've been using

# üç™ Things to snack on

A lot of great insights about issues in how design orgs do their recruitment in **[Design orgs are their own greatest impediment to success in recruiting and hiring](https://www.petermerholz.com/blog/design-orgs-are-their-own-greatest-impediment-to-success-in-recruiting-and-hiring/)** by **Peter Merholz**. The common problems the article mentions: Design teams rely too much on the HR / recruiter teams, design teams don't spend enough time on hiring, the roles to be hired are not defined well enough, the process ignores best practices (for length, preparing interviewers and having no clear assessment guidelines). The article also gives some tips and best practices for these common issues.

**[Redesigning our product design hiring process](https://uxdesign.cc/redesigning-our-product-design-hiring-process-de7d0ee80515)** is a great use case by **Sean Filiatrault**. From the process they've started with, the challenges for candidates sound quite widespread, as the challenges for the team (especially the negative reputation can have long term impact). 

I liked the learnings by the **Faire Design Team** in **[Designing an interview process for product designers](https://craft.faire.com/designing-an-interview-process-for-product-designers-b6ada19a957b)**. Preparing candidates with an interview guide for candidates sounds helpful to take some of the bias and stress out of the process, while training interviewers helped them to reach their hiring goals and removed some of the more subjective judgments. 

Though about engineering process, a lot of good insights in **[Develop Your Hiring System Like a Product to Eliminate Bias and Boost Retention](https://review.firstround.com/develop-your-hiring-system-like-a-product-to-eliminate-bias-and-boost-retention)** over at First Round Review, treating the hiring process like product development. The article details how **Dan Pupius** applied this approach at Medium: Starting with a vision (what sort of team to build), principles (guidelines to apply to each candidate) to make decisions, tactics (how to execute the process steps), what to measure (also collecting feedback from candidates), and how to iterate. 

A few good tips and tactics by **Rachel Krause** to use in **[Applying UX-Workshop Techniques to the Hiring Process](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-workshops-in-hiring/)**. As in design work, the divergence and convergence is important to reduce bias and group thinking in the process - writing feedback about candidates alone and discussing together allows for more details to emerge. Prioritization matrices are good for putting the desired competencies into relation to each other.

**Evan Sunwall** writes specifically about hiring interviews and differences between going with the flow, and making them unstructured or making them structured in **[Hiring Interviews Are Terrible: Smart UX Teams Structure Them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/structured-hiring-interviews/)**. Since hiring interviews are similar to user interviews, it makes a lot of sense that spending more energy on them leads to better outcomes.
