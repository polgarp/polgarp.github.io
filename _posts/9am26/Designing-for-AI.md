# ‚òï Designing for AI

I'm keep getting asked how to design for AI.

Wrote an article a couple of years ago, when machine learning started to catch up. But recent advances, especially on the generative AI front makes me wish to update it. 

First point, AI is a tech and depending on the exact technique used, design needs to happen differently.

Ultimately, the best way to get into AI design is to play with it. Explore generative tools, try to get APi - this helps in understanding the material of design. Or maybe a more closer idea is mobile design - those who didn't had a touchscreen mobile (khm, iPhone), were missing out what these devices were capable of.

If you are not using these generative tools today, you might be missing out.

But also, these are tech - for example comparable how databases changed the type of software we could design. Which also means designers need to have some level of understanding what these systems can do.

But also getting through the hype is a question. As of writing this, prompt engineering is all the rage, that is how to ask the right quesions from generative systems (ChatGPT, Midjourney etc) to get great results. Will this be important? 

Also, with generative AI most of the UX is centered around text boxes. Will this remain so? Maybe as long as generative is a feature rather than the root of new products.

Fundamental questions to think about
- Interaction model
- Solutions that were hard earlier, are now easy.
- Experiences that were fixed, can be more dynamic.
- How to design experiences with uncertain outcomes? Things are often good enough, do we accept 95% good enough rate?


I won't even get it ethical (and legal) question, it seems like an unstable Jenga tower about to collapse.

# üç™ Things to snack on

There is a lot of hype going on around AI, and it's sometimes tough to understands what matters and why. I found the [**The Algorithmic Bridge**](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/) newsletter by **Alberto Romero** quite helpful to follow trends slightly above the technical level and a bit farther away from the hype arena.

To understand how to design with AI, designers should explore by creating new things, argues **Gus Baggermans** in [**Embracing AI as a material for design**](https://uxdesign.cc/embracing-ai-as-a-material-for-design-b2986f7af7ed). The article also gives some general guidelines: Play responsibly, Design for discoverability, Help people navigate the maze of possibilities, and Consider legal & ethical implications. 

[**Design for AI: What should people who design AI know?**](https://uxdesign.cc/design-for-ai-what-should-people-who-design-ai-know-761e78fdabb) is a tool and an attempt to define what design skills will be needed for creating systems with AI by **Hal Wuertz**. It provides some useful behaviors for the five skill categories it presents (Technical, Ethics, Collaboration, Strategy, and Interactions). The list of behaviors might also give ideas for what skills to learn or improve.

16 excellent principles and added context to learn more by **Lennart Zibruski** in [**UX of AI**](https://uxofai.com/). Some of the principles just show how designing for AI is not that different from designing any software ("Start with the user"), while others are quite specific ("Explain the results"). 

**Jo√´l van Bodegraven** focuses on anticipatory design (how systems will think ahead the users) in  [**Design principles for AI-driven UX**](https://uxdesign.cc/ai-driven-ux-design-7735bdefbffc), describing systems designed with AI as simply "smart". The article also gives 5 principles to get started: Smart design has a purpose, Smart design is an extension of human capabilities, smart design anticipates, smart design should humanise experiences, smart design is proactive.

Google published a bunch of great and insightful articles, starting with [**The UX of AI**](https://design.google/library/ux-ai/) by **Josh Lovejoy** which is a case study about the Clips camera. Three main points on how AI needs human-centered design: solutions need to address a real human need, the intelligence needs guidance, and building trust needs to be core.

One problem with current machine learning based systems is that sometimes it's unclear why they do something the way they do it. This is the explainability problem, as **Meg Kurdziolek** writes in  [**Explaining the Unexplainable: Explainable AI (XAI) for UX**](https://uxpamagazine.org/explaining-the-unexplainable-explainable-ai-xai-for-ux/). The article provides an overview on techniques data scientist use. More importantly also, on how this problem affects users, as most users won't have a good mental model on what's happening inside such a system.
