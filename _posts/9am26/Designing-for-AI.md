# ‚òï Designing for AI

I'm keep getting asked how to design for AI.

Wrote an article a couple of years ago, when machine learning started to catch up. But recent advances, especially on the generative AI front makes me wish to update it. 

First point, AI is a tech and depending on the exact technique used, design needs to happen differently.

Ultimately, the best way to get into AI design is to play with it. Explore generative tools, try to get APi - this helps in understanding the material of design.
