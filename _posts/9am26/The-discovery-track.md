# ‚òï Discovery is more than user research

It's about making sure we build the right thing. But this goes beyond

Discovery is one of the those terms that describes very simply what needs to happen in product development, but since it's so easy adopt, practitioners often try to fill it up with their own ideas. If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

"the work we do to¬†make decisions¬†about what to build" - as [Teresa Torres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAABQIBksTwFRyWlc2Rz43Z-BbuVG8zw54 "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAABQIBksTwFRyWlc2Rz43Z-BbuVG8zw54") puts it.


Product discovery being part of dual track agile resolves the question when sh

It's about looking at the basic assumptions, getting insights. 

Assumptions can come in many flavours, but basically they relate to four types of risks.

It needs to address the four types of risks.

As a side note, these aspects are related: for example with high value previously unfeasable (for exampel too expensive) solutions can turn into feasible. So working on each othese risks is tightly connected.

Which means discovery should address all of these, not only the usability risk (that narrivly practiced user research often goes for)

This also means discovery is a team effort.

IT's a team effort. So if only designers or researchers and disegners participate in discovery, it's not really discovery at all, probably missing some of the risks the discovery process intended to address. It's nice to give space for design, but limits what designing means.

Also discovery is not always needed. Soetimes the problem is trivial, and design can keep up with minimal effort with engineering.

When starting out with discovery teams need to get over two big challenges: more time frame needed outside of the common agile sprint format - so introducing dual track and separating efforts is important. The second is getting time commitment. Design usually readily umps into this, as there are already tensions with just working in sprints. Product might need convincing how a simple PRD might not be enough to actually make valuable things. While Engineering needs feedback how it's worth taking time off from delivery to make sure we deliver the right things.

Product discovery is usually paired with delivery in a development process usually named dual track agile. **Jeff Patton**'s  [Dual Track Development is not Duel Track](http://jpattonassociates.com/dual-track-development/) describes the origin of the term, the differences between discovery and delivery, and how product teams need to do both activites at the same time.

Besides offering a good primer on discovery, [The critical role of discovery in product development
](https://uxdesign.cc/the-critical-role-of-discovery-in-product-development-6f50bf196722) by **Matthew Godfrey** offers a view on collaboration in discovery. It's usually lead by the product manager, product designer and technical lead, while other disciplines can join temporarily the efforts.
