# ‚òï Discovery is more than user research

Discovery in product development defines the group of activites that need to happen so the team knows what is the right product to build. As [Teresa Torres](https://www.producttalk.org/) puts it: *the work we do to¬†make decisions¬†about what to build*.

Since multiple people make decisions about what to build, I often hear practitioners reframing their exisitng approach as discovery. For example designers calling user research as discovery, or product managers talking to a few customers and writing a PRD and calling it a day. If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. 

Figuring out what the right product is needs input from all members of a product team (the [**product trio**]({% post_url 9am26/2023/2023-06-26-Product-trios-for-designers %}) approach), and thus a combination of activities. 




Product discovery being part of dual track agile resolves the question when sh

It's about looking at the basic assumptions, getting insights. 

Assumptions can come in many flavours, but basically they relate to four types of risks.

It needs to address the four types of risks.

As a side note, these aspects are related: for example with high value previously unfeasable (for exampel too expensive) solutions can turn into feasible. So working on each othese risks is tightly connected.

Which means discovery should address all of these, not only the usability risk (that narrivly practiced user research often goes for)

This also means discovery is a team effort.

IT's a team effort. So if only designers or researchers and disegners participate in discovery, it's not really discovery at all, probably missing some of the risks the discovery process intended to address. It's nice to give space for design, but limits what designing means.

Also discovery is not always needed. Soetimes the problem is trivial, and design can keep up with minimal effort with engineering.

When starting out with discovery teams need to get over two big challenges: more time frame needed outside of the common agile sprint format - so introducing dual track and separating efforts is important. The second is getting time commitment. Design usually readily umps into this, as there are already tensions with just working in sprints. Product might need convincing how a simple PRD might not be enough to actually make valuable things. While Engineering needs feedback how it's worth taking time off from delivery to make sure we deliver the right things.

# üç™ Things to snack on

Product discovery is usually paired with delivery in a development process usually named dual track agile. **Jeff Patton**'s  [Dual Track Development is not Duel Track](http://jpattonassociates.com/dual-track-development/) describes the origin of the term, the differences between discovery and delivery, and how product teams need to do both activites at the same time.

Besides offering a good primer on discovery, [The critical role of discovery in product development
](https://uxdesign.cc/the-critical-role-of-discovery-in-product-development-6f50bf196722) by **Matthew Godfrey** offers a view on collaboration in discovery. It's usually lead by the product manager, product designer and technical lead, while other disciplines can join temporarily the efforts. 

<p style="text-align: center;">‚ô†</p>

If discovery is building the right product, it's important to understand how the wrong product could be built. This is where understanding the various risk types is helpful. **Marty Cagan** describes four types of risks in [Product Risk Taxonomy](https://www.svpg.com/product-risk-taxonomies/): value, usability, feasibility and viability. By covering each of these risks, product teams discover what product they should build.

<p style="text-align: center;">‚ô†</p>

**Chris Jones** in [Product Discovery: Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns](http://svpg.com/product-discovery-anti-patterns/) categorizes discovery mistakes into 6 categories. These are: Confirmation-biased discovery (focusing on an alreadz established solution), product-as-a-prtotype discovery (mistaken delivery), partial-team discovery (doesn't address all risks), one-dimensional discovery (focused on a single method or approach), big-bang discovery (lacking continuity), outsourced discovery (expecting others can learn instead of us). There are also some tips to get it right.

<p style="text-align: center;">‚ô†</p>

The ultimate result of discovery is better outcomes for the users. This is main reason of handling discovery as a team level activity, rather than focused only on specific aspect. In [Doing Discovery Well: How to Measure and Guide Your Team](https://www.producttalk.org/2020/06/measure-discovery/), **Teresa Torres** shows that the good lagging indicator for discovery is how well the team reaches their desired outcome. As a more immediate measure, cycle time between activites can be used, like how often the team talks to a user, runs an expriment, or throws away solutions.
