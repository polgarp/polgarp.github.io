**[Three Pillars of User Delight](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pillars-user-delight/)** by Therese Fessenden

Loved **[The World's Most Satisfying Checkbox](https://www.andy.works/words/the-most-satisfying-checkbox)** by Andy Works, which is a nice case study about delight.

**[Designing for ‚Äúdelight‚Äù is dead](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-delight-is-dead-677bca6aebd1)**

**[Guiding principles to design for delight](https://uxplanet.org/guiding-principles-to-design-for-delight-a1d04a809fd9)**

**[The Kano Analysis](https://medium.muz.li/the-kano-analysis-c16e7d681158)**

Two great articles by Jared Spool on delight:

- **[Is ‚ÄòDelight‚Äô the Best UX Design Intention?](https://jmspool.medium.com/is-delight-the-best-ux-design-intention-331053fca4b1)**. Since design is the rendering of intent, delight should be part of the intent. Delight is the opposite of frustration, something design wants to remove. If expectations are not met, that's frustration. If expectations are exceeded, that's delight. So delight is the best intent we can have.
- **[Pleasure, Flow, and Meaning - The 3 Approaches to Designing for Delight](https://articles.uie.com/pleasure_flow_and_meaning/)** introduces Dana Chisnell‚Äôs framework, Three Approaches to¬†Delight. Pleasure is one way - humor, great content that gives peopel confidence, removing unneccesary friction. Flow: better user flows, steps the user needs to go through. Meaning is if there is a story for the user. But for this to work, basic UX needs to be there, that is delight should be authentic.
