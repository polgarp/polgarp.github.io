(Thanks for the topic idea, Gabor!)

Over the last couple of month I've been reading a lot of alarming articles about the state of the UX design industry, and talking with friend and mentees I see the same thing. Something is not right. (Khm, layoffs). While the broader discussion is certainly interesting, I'd like to focus on what the changes we see means for product design and research leaders, and what can we learn from this situation.

To acknowledge something. Wartime within the context of software creation means one thing, and it's a completely different thing when your country is in an actual war, for example with Ukraine. Obviously the leadership a real war takes i



When things don't go well, the voices talking about how design is slow, how research takes too much time get louder - blaming things on the design team, rather then trying to search for solutions that involve everyone involved.

# üç™ Things to snack on

**Hang Xu**'s [**LinkedIn post**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7074376898830573568/) talks about the grim mood of people in the UX field. The disillusionment is mostly focused on topics that supposedly provides a good environment for creating great UX and high maturity, including collaboration with partners, working on real problems, and focusing on the depths of solutions. While the designers who seem to be happier are looking more on inward things, like developing technical skills.

[**UX Directors are in a world of hurt**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ux-directors-world-hurt-peter-merholz/) is a somber description of what we are facing by **Peter Merholz**, that probably applies to not only directors, but to every design leader. While middle managers are generally under fire from multiple sides, UX directors are in a particularly bad situation. They work with executives who don't know how to guide their teams. They work with product management partners who don't know how to do their jobs. They are under-leveled to their peers. They are usually the most senior person in the design org. To combat these, design leaders need to be pragmatic and play the game in their organization, which is very different to what designers usually do.

The differences between wartime and peacetime are differences in worldviews according to **John Cutler**. In [**Productivity (The Clash)**](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-231-productivity-the-clash/) he writes how habits that worked in a peacetime, suddenly don't work. Depending on culture and perspective, there might be a large variety of narratives on what the issue is, and this leads to clashes between disciplines, managers and reports, and people from various countries. There might be no rational way to resolve these differences, other than listening building bridges.

[**Peacetime Design Leader / Wartime Design Leader**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/peacetime-design-leader-wartime-dmitry-nekrasovski/) is an overview of the differences in tactics used by design leaders by **Dmitry Nekrasovski**.

**Mia Blume** has a few great tips on how to weather a storm in  [**Storm vs. calm leadership tactics**](https://blog.designdept.co/storm-vs-calm-leadership-tactics-e64a63aab0da). In peacetime, a leader can focus on a few things to prepare for the storm: create a vision, invest in quality, build the skills of the team, and build a culture of innovation. When the storm comes, there are seven tactics to lead through: 1. Know your business model and the current stakes. 2. Get real about efficiency and prioritization. 3. Manage performance swiftly and hold people accountable regularly. 4. Increase communication around value generation. 5. Level up the people you have. 6. Tighten review and critique loops to keep momentum and quality up. Build sustainability into the system.

With the flurry of layoffs, it often seems design orgs, and particularly UX research teams suffer the most. Some say this is a crisis on also what research as a discipline should do, **Judd Antin**'s [**The UX Research Reckoning is Here**](https://medium.com/onebigthought/the-ux-research-reckoning-is-here-c63710ea4084/) is a good take on this. The article's argument is that researchers were focusing on the wrong type of research, centered around supporting the broader product development ("middle-range research"), while pushing to the background both strategic research that would influence business decisions ("macro-research") and technical usability ("micro-research"). I thought the reasoning about what went wrong is right here, and the proposed focus on micro and macro fits well into how wartime and peacetime leadership differs. Be sure to also read the followup, [**Discussing the Reckoning**](https://medium.com/onebigthought/discussing-the-reckoning-1b59d7ef7dcf).

**Gergely Orosz** has a longer article over in his newsletter, The Pragmatic Engineer, but his [**Linkedin post**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gergelyorosz_wartime-stressful-times-vs-peacetime-activity-7045361529432530944-AXnJ/) sums up the difference in challenges for engineering in wartime and peacetime. To succeed in peacetime, focus on quality, long term initiatives, doing things the right way, and avoid a risk of stagnation. To succeed in wartime, get things done quickly, work on things needed right now, try to set up a good pace, and avoid burn out.

Written at the start of COVID, [**Wartime Product Leadership**](https://medium.com/swlh/wartime-product-leadership-b820f8eb8c02/) by **Ben Foster** describes the challenges of product management in the changing environment.  In the peacetime, there is a clear view of the far horizon, so the focus is on delivery speed of outcomes over flexibility. Wartime is different, planning ahead is much more difficult, more flexibility is needed as direction might radically change on a short notice. This includes reallocating or even removing resources, including whole teams from certain initiatives. The article also gives five steps to transition from peacetime to wartime. 1. Stop anything that doesn't have impact right now. 2. Don't worry about the next year, but focus on the next few sprints. 3. Priorities set need to be tightly followed. 4. Cross-functional communication important to get new or save existing revenue. 5. Large changes might be needed based on what the markets do.
