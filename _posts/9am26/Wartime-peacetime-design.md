(Thanks for the topic idea, Gabor!)

Over the last couple of month I've been reading a lot of alarming articles about the state of the UX design industry, and talking with friend and mentees I see the same thing. Something is not right. (Khm, layoffs). While the broader discussion is certainly interesting, I'd like to focus on what the changes we see means for product design and research leaders, and what can we learn from this situation.

To acknowledge something. Wartime within the context of software creation means one thing, and it's a completely different thing when your country is in an actual war, for example with Ukraine. Obviously the leadership a real war takes i

# üç™ Things to snack on

Gergely Orosz has a longer article over in his newsletter, The Pragmatic Enginber, but this [**Linkedin post**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gergelyorosz_wartime-stressful-times-vs-peacetime-activity-7045361529432530944-AXnJ/) summs app the challenges for engineering.

With the flurry of layoffs, it often seems design orgs, and particularly UX research teams suffer the most. Some say this is a crisis on also what the research as a discipline should do, **Judd Antin**'s [**The UX Research Reckoning is Here**](https://medium.com/onebigthought/the-ux-research-reckoning-is-here-c63710ea4084/) is a good take on this. The article's argument is that researcher were focusing on the wrong type of research, centered around supporting the broader product development ("middle-range research"), while pushing to the background both strategic research that would influence business decisions ("macro-research") and research on technical usability ("micro-research"). I thought the reasoning about what went wrong is right here, and the proposed focus on micro and macro fits well into how wartime and peacetime leadership differs. Be sure to also read the followup, [**Discussing the Reckoning**](https://medium.com/onebigthought/discussing-the-reckoning-1b59d7ef7dcf).

Written at the start of COVID, [**Wartime Product Leadership**](https://medium.com/swlh/wartime-product-leadership-b820f8eb8c02/) by **Ben Foster** describes on the challenges of product management in the changing environment.  In the peacetime, there is a clear view of the far horizon, so the focus is on delivery speed of outcomes over flexibility. Wartime is different, planning ahead is much more difficult, more flexibility is needed as direction might radically change on a short notice. This includes reallocating or even removing resources, including whole teams from certain initiatives. The article also gives five steps to transition from peacetime to wartime. 1. Stop anything that doesn't have impact right now. 2. Don't worry about the next year, but focus on the next few sprints. 3. Priorities set need to be tightly followed. 4. Cross-functional communication important to get new or save existing revenue. 5. Large changes might be needed based on what the markets do.
