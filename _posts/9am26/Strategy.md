# ‚òï UX or product design or whatever strategy


Strategy can be understood in multiple levels. But in essence it's a vision and the way to get there. 

It can be how the design team should be operating and what to do to get there. IT could be how the design team should support organisational strategy how to get there. It could be what UX goals the product needs to do and how to get there. This evolves as the maturity evolves.

Also some misalignment - UX team might be asked for a UX strategy, but the user's experience is affected by many things, most beyond the impact of the UX team, so the team will focus they have impact on, what the product's UI and interaction would be. That's why I like the term "product design" better. It's still a bit broad (engineering choices affect the product a lot, this contribute to product design afterall).

Designers of all levels should practice strategy. On an individual level, it could be describing a design goal, what good looks like and the process to get there. On a higher level more collab, more alignment is needed, while on the leadership level even more is needed.

It's also about alignment - being a plan on how the team will deliver value, and making it clear if the team working towards the goals of the broader organisation. As such strategy should avoid design lingo and speak to a wider group of stakeholders.

Ultimately strategy should describe how we are going to be successful, given our goals.

Product strategy and product design strategy are related but distinct concepts that are both important for the success of a tech startup or scaleup.

Product strategy focuses on defining the overall direction and goals for the product. It includes identifying the target audience, defining the product's unique value proposition, and creating a roadmap that outlines the product's development priorities. Product strategy is typically owned by product managers and involves collaboration with other stakeholders such as engineering, marketing, and sales.

Product design strategy, on the other hand, is focused on the specific design elements of the product. It includes defining the design problem, conducting user research, creating user personas, developing a design language, creating user flows and wireframes, and testing and iterating on designs. Product design strategy is owned by the design team and involves collaboration with cross-functional teams such as product management, engineering, and marketing.

In essence, the product design strategy is a more tactical and focused approach that is guided by the broader product strategy. The product design strategy is aligned with the product strategy and aims to create a user experience that meets the needs and expectations of the target audience and supports the overall product vision.

By having a clear product strategy and product design strategy, a tech startup or scaleup can create a product that is more likely to succeed in the market, meet the needs of its target audience, and achieve its business goals.

UX strategy refers to the plan or approach taken by a company or organization to create and deliver a user experience that meets the needs and expectations of its target audience. It involves aligning the company's business goals and objectives with the needs and goals of its users to create a product or service that is valuable, usable, and desirable.

A UX strategy typically includes research, analysis, and planning, as well as the implementation and evaluation of design solutions. It may involve defining user personas, conducting user research, creating user flows and wireframes, designing interfaces, and testing and iterating on designs.

A well-defined UX strategy helps companies create products and services that are more likely to succeed in the market, improve customer satisfaction, and increase engagement and retention. It also helps companies differentiate themselves from competitors by creating a unique and valuable user experience.

1.  User research: One of the most important aspects of product design and UX strategy is conducting user research. It's essential to understand your target audience's needs, pain points, and expectations before designing any product or feature.
    
2.  Competitive analysis: Analyzing your competitors' products can help you identify gaps and opportunities in the market. It's crucial to understand the competitive landscape to design a product that stands out from the crowd.
    
3.  Design thinking: Design thinking is a methodology that can help teams solve complex problems. It involves empathizing with users, defining the problem, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing.
    
4.  User-centered design: User-centered design puts the user at the center of the design process. It involves designing a product that meets users' needs, is easy to use, and provides an excellent user experience.
    
5.  Collaboration: Collaboration is key to successful product design and UX strategy. It's essential to work closely with cross-functional teams, including product managers, developers, and stakeholders, to ensure everyone is aligned on the product vision and goals.
6.  Agile methodology: Agile methodology is a project management approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. It's often used in product design and UX teams to ensure they can quickly iterate and adapt to changing user needs and market trends.
    
2.  Data analysis: Analyzing user data can help you understand how users interact with your product, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions.
    
3.  Design systems: Design systems are a set of standards, guidelines, and reusable components that help ensure consistency and efficiency in the design process. They can help streamline the design process and ensure a cohesive user experience.
    
4.  Accessibility: Accessibility is an essential aspect of product design and UX strategy. It's important to design products that are accessible to users with disabilities and meet accessibility standards.
    
5.  Continuous learning: Product design and UX strategy are continually evolving, so it's essential to stay up-to-date with industry trends, best practices, and emerging technologies. Continuous learning and professional development are crucial for design leaders and their teams.

[**UX Strategy: Definition and Components**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-strategy/) by **Anna Kaley and Sarah Gibbons**

[**What makes a UX Strategy successful**](https://uxdesign.cc/what-makes-a-ux-strategy-successful-ebdb72641968) by **Bilgi Karan**

The design strategy is usually part of a broader product strategy, so should contribute to that, as **Matthew Godfrey** argues in [**The Anatomy of Design Strategy**](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/the-anatomy-of-design-strategy-75be8cfa3dc3). This means the design strategy should talk about the necessary experience changes, what success would look like, what opportunities to target, how the current experience looks like and what a future experience would look like. There are some further helpful tips on what each of these sections should contain.

I found the four dimensions in [**Level, Depth, Time, and Frame**](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-218-level-depth-time-and-frame) by **John Cutler** extremely useful to understand how strategy can have very different meanings based on the context it's created. Level is where it sits in the organizational hierarchy. Depth tells about how specific or high level the strategy is. Time gives the timeframe, how long the strategy is to be followed without change. Finally the Frame describes the focus or focuses (for product design this could be about the culture, the product capabilities, the customer or even something else). Thinking about these dimensions helps in creating appropriate constraints for the strategy.

While strategy is important, it's just part of a bigger palette of tools that build a the design culture. [**Culture Eats UX Strategy for Breakfast**](https://medium.com/on-experience/culture-eats-ux-strategy-for-breakfast-2a805d47097e) by **Liam Friedland** is a nice overview on the pieces. Besides UX Strategy, the others described by the article are Research Program, Innovation Program, Design Program, UX Ops, Growing People, Evangelize + Promote, and Relations + Alliances.

Vision is at the core of strategy, and experience vision is what describes a great user experience. **Jared Spool** gives a brief introduction with some examples about why the vision matters and how it ties things together in [**The Experience Vision: A Self-Fulfilling UX¬†Strategy**](https://articles.uie.com/the-experience-vision-a-self-fulfilling-ux-strategy/).
