Having a clear strategy is what sets apart mediocre design teams and good teams. It helps to have the right impact.

# ‚òï UX strategy

In any given moment, a design leader can chose to do any one thing from a long and ever expanding list of things. Improve user research? Iterate on the design system? Change the team composition? Focus on new users? Create a journey map? A few things can help to decide which one to do. If the team has an idea where they want to go. If that is aligned with what the company wants to do. If the team already spent some time on deciding how to get there. In short, if the team has a strategy.

Strategy is one of those words we talk about a lot, but in a somehow under defined manner. More senior designers are usually expected to think about strategy while they work in their product teams. Design leaders are usually expected to have a strategy that defines what their team focuses on.

Depending on the context, strategy means different things. For a designers working on the product it's more about how the end goal would be reached, so what steps, in what order, what methods, and how the problems and solutions are approached. On a design team level it's more about what practices, what projects the team should be taking on.

Either way, a strategy in essence is a goal, a vision of a different and desired future state and the way, the approach taken to get there. 

To be sure, a good strategy helps good teams determine what to focus on and to grow and increase their impact.




It's usually clear the design team needs to have a strategy, usually driven by the leader. 

Designers of all levels should practice strategy. On an individual level, it could be describing a design goal, what good looks like and the process to get there. On a higher level more collab, more alignment is needed, while on the leadership level even more is needed.





Getting together: define goal or more a vision. Research experience, collect input from internal stakeholders. Compose plans how we gonna get there.

A UX strategy typically includes research, analysis, and planning, as well as the implementation and evaluation of design solutions. It may involve defining user personas, conducting user research, creating user flows and wireframes, designing interfaces, and testing and iterating on designs.

Plan components to think about while preparing a strategy:
- User research:  It's essential to understand your target audience's needs, pain points, and expectations before designing any product or feature.
- Competitive analysis: It's crucial to understand the competitive landscape to design a product that stands out from the crowd.
- Design thinking: As a methodology that can help teams solve complex problems while involving a wider group of stakeholders or co-create with customers.
- Collaboration: How the team should work with cross-functional teams, including product managers, developers, and stakeholders, to ensure everyone is aligned on the product vision and goals. Also determines organizational setup - the strategy should drive org design and not the other way around.
- Design systems: They can help to streamline the design process and ensure a cohesive user experience.
- Accessibility: Accessibility is an essential aspect of product design and UX strategy. It's important to design products that are accessible to users with disabilities and meet accessibility standards.
- Continuous growth: Product design and UX strategy are continually evolving, so it's essential to stay up-to-date with industry trends, best practices, and emerging technologies. Continuous learning and professional development are crucial for design leaders and their teams.



A question with UX strategy is the relation to the overall product or even company strategy. This usually depends on the organizational setup for it to be executable. For most product design teams working from the product organization, their strategy should be part of the product strategy, closely aligned with product engineering's and product management's strategy.

Product strategy focuses on defining the overall direction and goals for the product. It includes identifying the target audience, defining the product's unique value proposition, and creating a roadmap that outlines the product's development priorities. Product strategy is typically owned by product managers and involves collaboration with other stakeholders such as engineering, marketing, and sales.

Product design strategy, on the other hand, is focused on the specific design elements of the product. It includes defining the design problem, conducting user research, creating user personas, developing a design language, creating user flows and wireframes, and testing and iterating on designs. Product design strategy is owned by the design team and involves collaboration with cross-functional teams such as product management, engineering, and marketing.

Also some misalignment - UX team might be asked for a UX strategy, but the user's experience is affected by many things, most beyond the impact of the UX team, so the team will focus they have impact on, what the product's UI and interaction would be. That's why I like the term "product design" better. It's still a bit broad (engineering choices affect the product a lot, this contribute to product design afterall).

It's also about alignment - being a plan on how the team will deliver value, and making it clear if the team working towards the goals of the broader organisation. As such strategy should avoid design lingo and speak to a wider group of stakeholders.

# üç™ Things to snack on

[**UX Strategy: Definition and Components**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-strategy/) by **Anna Kaley and Sarah Gibbons** dissects the primary components of a UX strategy (vison, plan, goals) with examples for each. The article also describes the part of strategies usually less-talked about, how to go about execution, what factors support effectiveness and efficiency of execution.

**Bilgi Karan** talks about three qualities of UX strategy in [**What makes a UX Strategy successful**](https://uxdesign.cc/what-makes-a-ux-strategy-successful-ebdb72641968). These are Brave (going beyond mediocre to create the company's unfair advantage), Clear (making decisions easy to do), and Grounded (aligned with the rest of the organization). 

The design strategy is usually part of a broader product strategy, so should contribute to that, as **Matthew Godfrey** argues in [**The Anatomy of Design Strategy**](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/the-anatomy-of-design-strategy-75be8cfa3dc3). This means the design strategy should talk about the necessary experience changes, what success would look like, what opportunities to target, how the current experience looks like and what a future experience would look like. There are some further helpful tips on what each of these sections should contain.

While strategy is important, it's just part of a bigger palette of tools that build a the design culture. [**Culture Eats UX Strategy for Breakfast**](https://medium.com/on-experience/culture-eats-ux-strategy-for-breakfast-2a805d47097e) by **Liam Friedland** is a nice overview on the pieces. Besides UX Strategy, the others described by the article are Research Program, Innovation Program, Design Program, UX Ops, Growing People, Evangelize + Promote, and Relations + Alliances.

Vision is at the core of strategy, and experience vision is what describes a great user experience. **Jared Spool** gives a brief introduction with some examples about why the vision matters and how it ties things together in [**The Experience Vision: A Self-Fulfilling UX¬†Strategy**](https://articles.uie.com/the-experience-vision-a-self-fulfilling-ux-strategy/).

I found the four dimensions in [**Level, Depth, Time, and Frame**](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-218-level-depth-time-and-frame) by **John Cutler** extremely useful to understand how strategy can have very different meanings based on the context it's created. Level is where it sits in the organizational hierarchy. Depth tells about how specific or high level the strategy is. Time gives the timeframe, how long the strategy is to be followed without change. Finally the Frame describes the focus or focuses (for product design this could be about the culture, the product capabilities, the customer or even something else). Thinking about these dimensions helps in creating appropriate constraints for the strategy.
