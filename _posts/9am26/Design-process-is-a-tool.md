# ☕ Design process is a tool

Is it for alignment? Communicating what the team does? Guidance for more junior designers? A way to scale the design team? Promoting better design practices? 

Juniors need to learn what to do. Seniors need to know when to break.

Process is multifaceted, tries to capture tasks, collaboration, timelines, planning.
