# ☕ Managing designers vs managing researchers

(Thanks for the topic idea, David Udvardy!)

For most of my time as a design leader I've been managing both researchers and designers. People management is pretty similar between the two roles, but there are a few notable differences.

Organizations might define these roles differently, there is a kinda consensus in the industry about what they do. 

Product designers are responsible for how the product behaves, including all elements of a product the user interacts with. This might go beyond the immediate product and extend to things like service design, product marketing or user documentation. UX researchers on the other hand are focused on understanding the needs, behaviors, and preferences of users, including creating artifacts that facilitate understanding for the wider team.

Beyond role definitions, research and design skills often flow into each other. Most designers should have some research skills, while researchers often make capable interaction designers or information architects. At the minimum both roles should have enough knowledge to give informed feedback on artifacts. However it's more common for designers to do some research, while it's quite rare for researchers to do design. Research is usually a more specialized role.

Ultimately the biggest difference between these roles comes from how the org is set up. In the end, the main distinction between these positions stems from the organization's structure. This sets their duties, abilities, tasks, and who they should work with closely. As a result, managing these two roles differently is greatly influenced by the setup.

Managing these two roles is quite similar for the most part, the common advice on how to be a good coach applies to both. Things like having [1on1s]({% post_url 9am26/2023-05-08-1-on-1s-strengthening-the-team-with-coaching %}), helping people grow, working together on career development (separate [career ladder]({% post_url 9am26/2023-04-03-Career-ladders-chart-a-path-for-the-teams-growth %}) is helpful), handling performance, balancing direction, aligning and empowering, providing context, or building trust and safe spaces should be common practices as a manager. [Hiring]({% post_url 9am26/2023-03-06-Building-great-design-teams-with-a-purposeful-hiring-process %}) should be slightly adjusted, based by the org setup and craft differences.

Where things start to differ is craft, role responsibilities, and value created. There is also a strategic difference.

Craft is simple - managers with researcher reports should have an understanding how good research done, what are the available methods, what's doable and what's not. These help to support researchers when needed. With designers these are similar, but obviously for design activities and artifacts. In short, the manager should be able to jump in and at the minimum be able to ask good questions and help people find answers.

Role responsibilities is more difficult to handle well and is often a source of conflict. Designers mostly work in product teams, while researchers might support multiple teams or other orgs. Researchers focus on more macro level and the [problem space]({% post_url 9am26/2023-06-05-Problem-space-solution-space %}), as they work with the journeys of users. Designers focus more on the context and the [solution space]({% post_url 9am26/2023-06-05-Problem-space-solution-space %}), as they work on new features or pieces of the experience. 

The difference in focus and on a higher level creates friction that is sometimes desirable, but if communication fails it leads to conflicts. Working more closely together helps in removing some of the friction. [Pair design]({% post_url 9am26/2023-03-13-Pair-design-leads-to-better-design-collaboration %}) is helpful, as it enables both roles to build on their strengths. Managing the two roles together needs active listening and building understanding of the other role's methods, and empathy to different ways of working.




focus on supporting team research activites, and more macro and strategic level things. Practice sure differs, designers needs pointers on design critique, researchers on usability tests. Pair design roles are helpful to define aspirations. Practices is tactics, but strategy is similar - why we want great UX. 

There will be conflicts. So provide spaces to have the discussion - structuring design process helps, creating practices such as design critique helps, but really, it's more about making sure there are conversations. 

PAir design rules.

# 🍪 Things to snack on

The better understand the role of a design leader, [**Coach, Diplomat, Advocate, Architect: The Four Archetypes of the Design Leader**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJCUti7XSD8) is an awesome talk by **Peter Merholz**. The first part talks about being a coach and managing people. It gives a great overview on the role of being a leader specific to design teams. This is useful for managing both researchers and designers.

<p style="text-align: center;">🀲</p>

Intercom's [**How to have impact as a designer**](https://www.intercom.com/blog/product-designer-impact/) by **Paul Murphy** gives a good framework to think about designer's performance, though this can be used for researchers too. Impact considerations (this is where the article focuses) and collaboration expectations should be fairly similar for both researchers and designers, while leadership differs, as what can be considered quality of work.

<p style="text-align: center;">🀲</p>

The most important part of managing UX researchers is making sure they get questions that they can answer, as **Yaron Cohen** argues in [**How to manage UX researchers**](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/how-to-manage-ux-researchers-15e0f85dcf36). This means helping shaping questions, making sure there is available data (for example ensuring a budget to recruit participants, or enable access to users), and providing a context for their inquiry. The article has a few more rules of thumb regarding performing research.

<p style="text-align: center;">🀲</p>

Thinking about what usually doesn't work is a good exercise to figure out what to focus on, and this goes for helping designers. **John Zeratsky** wrote a nice list of issues designers face in [**8 common dysfunctions of design teams—and what to do about them**](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/common-dysfunctions-design-teams/). I liked polishing a brick (working on small details of a product with uncertain value) and starting with solutions the most, seeing these often at work in designers' work.

**Jim Ross** writes about skills important to researchers in [**Qualities of Effective User Researchers**](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/11/qualities-of-effective-user-researchers.php), both soft skills (like pragmatism or ability to learn quickly) and research skills (like effective note taking or writing skills). This is a good starter list to see what to focus on when coaching researchers.
