# ‚òï Managing designers vs managing researchers

Research and design skills often flow into each other, there are "researchers" with design skills as the other way around. In organizations where these are separate roles, org setup changes where the roles focus up. Everyone is a UXer or a designer.

In the orgs I've worked with designers typically‚Ä¶ while researchers typically. This makes a difference how the two roles would be managed, but by not much.

In some orgs, research is a skill for designers, but it's rare to have it the other way around.

There are common challenges - related to team and career development. Having a separate career ladder (for each separate role) is helpful.

Have 1:1s, build confidence, everyone likes feedback, make sure to balance directions.

Where things start to differ is how overall job mission impacts their incentives and daily work. Assumed the designers mostly work on product teams, while researchers focus on supporting team research activites, and more macro and strategic level things. Practice sure differs, designers needs pointers on design critique, researchers on usability tests. Pair design roles are helpful to define aspirations. Practices is tactics, but strategy is similar - why we want great UX. 

Routines are different and effective time practices are different. Some of the skills are same

Obviously good undestanding needed for whatever they are doing. LEaders w design background might have trouble, also the other way aroud.

When staring to manage designers, focus on:

When starting with researchers, focus on:

There will be conflicts. So provide spaces to have the discussion - structuring design process helps, creating practices such as design critique helps, but really, it's more about making sure there are conversations.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÄ≤</p>

The most important part of managing UX researchers is making sure they get questions that they can answer, as **Yaron Cohen** argues in [**How to manage UX researchers**](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/how-to-manage-ux-researchers-15e0f85dcf36). This means helping shaping questions, making sure there is available data (for example ensuring a budget to recruit participants, or enable access to users), and providing a context for their inquiry. The article has a few more rules of thumb regarding performing research.

**Jim Ross** writes about skills important to researchers in [**Qualities of Effective User Researchers**](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/11/qualities-of-effective-user-researchers.php), both soft skills (like pragmatism or ability to learn quickly) and research skills (like effective note taking or writing skills). This is a good starter list to see what to focus on when coaching researchers. 

Intercom's [**How to have impact as a designer**](https://www.intercom.com/blog/product-designer-impact/) by **Paul Murphy** gives a good framework to think about designer's performance, though this can be used for researchers too. Impact considerations (this is where the article focuses) and collaboration expectations should be fairly similar for both researchers and designers, while leadership differs, as what can be considered quality of work.
