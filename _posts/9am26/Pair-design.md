# ‚òï  Pair design

While collaboration is the way to go, the reality is, that most design still happen in maker time, a lone researcher or designer leaning over a piece of paper, a table or a Figma canvas. But often this doesn't lead to the most creative outputs.

A way to increase design quality

Also helps in articulation - as ideas need to immediately spelled out. 

Roots in pair programming (according to XP it's...)

Think about roles, even create role cards if that helps.

Great for reseerachers to collaborate and bring in user insights.

For design leaders the practice of pair design is an opportunity to get better design. How to do this? Selecting pairs from the team to collaborate regurarly. Pair from different fields. Pair seniors with less seniors. Pair researchers with designers - different skills.
