# ‚òï  Pair design

Modern product design is a deeply collaborative discipline. Weather it's the discovery process within the product team, or functional practices like **[design critiques]({% post_url 2022-09-15-Design-critique-the-core-practice-for-design-teams %})**, there are a lot of opportunities to exchange ideas and get feedback. 

While collaboration is the name of the game, reality is more nuanced. Designers often work alone as the sole designer in a product team. Design work happens in maker time, a lone researcher or designer leaning over a piece of paper, a spreadsheet or a Figma canvas focused to ready some artifacts for the next round. This is necessary for detailed work to happen, but often doesn't lead to the highest quality output.

The trade-off with this setup (designers in product teams, occasionally collaborating with other designers) is that designers are slower to level up their game as they don't learn that much from each other, there is no shared knowledge in case a designer leaves the company, and the overall UX of the software suffers as there is less clarity about the boundaries, how features connect to each other.

This where pair design comes in. On a surface level, two designers sitting and designing together a single piece of product sounds like any other type of collaborating, or maybe even avoiding progress in work and just generally being inefficient. But the opposite is true. 

While timewise pair design might take longer, the overall efficiency in terms of quality is much higher. Since within the process there are already two pairs of eyes on the design decisions, there are less obvious issues in the end, while having to **[articulate design decisions]({% post_url 2023-02-27-Articulating-design-decisions-makes-design-work-transparent %})** as they happen makes the overall design rationale better, more likely to fulfill the intended outcome. This type of collaboration is also more inspiring and energizing, contributing to overall design team happiness. Finally, pair design allows team members to learn from each other, so it's especially valuable to level up junior or mid-level designers. 

Pair design has it's roots in pair programming, though the advantages are slightly different (it's more about the overall app UX than having less bugs in a piece of code). Usually it's two designers collaborating , but  can work with any disciplines (so designer &researcher, designer & product manager, designer & engineer, or really any other combination). The difference to other type of collaborations (like workshops, reviews etc.) is the immersion into the problems and solutions, the strength of connection in the pairs and having clear focus with the different roles.

setting up

Generator, synth - or researcher and designer for fixed roles.
Pairs include design-design, or design-research, or cross functional or any other combination. I've worked a lot in both design-research and design-product pairs.
Great for reseerachers to collaborate and bring in user insights.
Think about roles, even create role cards if that helps.

Chose the right pairs, not everyone works together with everyone else well.

Within product organisations the setup is usually to have one designer per product team, so to combat designer loniless is pair design is a good practice. It's challenging to set up, since everyone has their own teams. A useful way is to allocate a few hours (1-4) very week and pair up designers for longer term, so they have understanding of the other team's context. 

Another way to set up up, especially for juniors is to not get them into product teams yet, as they need to develop their skills to be peers to product managers and engineers, so juniors should permanently pair up with more senior designers until they level up.

for leaders
For design leaders the practice of pair design is an opportunity to get better design. How to do this? Selecting pairs from the team to collaborate regurarly. Pair from different fields. Pair seniors with less seniors. Pair researchers with designers - different skills. 

Also a way to engage with designer's project. I did so called dialogues to 

**To recap**
- Pair design, two designers working together on a piece of design at the same time is different type of collaboration than workshops, reviews, critiques or anything with more than two persons present.
- Advantages are more efficient design process (better decision articulation and output quality), engaged and energized collaboration for designers, team members learning together.
- To get started set the roles, generator focuses on tactical level, drives forward, while synthesizer focuses on strategic level, brings in perspectives, data, navigates.
- With product teams (one designer per product team), the setup is to have long term pairs (quarter length) and allocate few hours per week to work together. Alternatively have project driver and navigator roles.
- This practice helps to level up junior and mid-level designers to be true peers in product teams by working with another, more senior designer.

# üç™ Things to snack on

The single best resource about this topic is the **[Pair Design](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pair-design/9781492042907/)** book by **Gretchen Anderson** and **Christopher Noessel** ([article version](https://www.oreilly.com/content/pair-design/)). If somebody is looking to adapt this practice, it's well worth reading trough, as this describes in detail how the collaboration goes along the design process, what's the right way to set up pair design, how it fits into broader team context, and also has a few case studies.

**Tom Kupka** has a pair design case study in **[Pair Design in practice](https://uxdesign.cc/%EF%B8%8F-pair-design-in-practice-2467eb4004e7)**. This details the background, how they set up the process, how roles changed over the phases of the design process and some nice learning to close. 

**Christopher Noessel** offers some example models for pair design in **[Pairaphors: Explaining pair design (metaphorically)](https://christophernoessel.medium.com/pairaphors-explaining-pair-design-metaphorically-7ebdaee70bf3)**. By thinking about analogues, the model of the collaboration and how to make it work right is easier to figure out. The article gives the following examples: Cooper's Generator & Synthesizer model, Pilots & Navigators, Artists & Producers, and (my favorite) Mulder & Scully.

While pair design as a concept is easy to get, it's sometimes difficult to figure out how pairing should happen. In **[3 Different Models Of Pair Design](https://mariyayao.com/3-models-pair-design/)** **Mariya Yao** lists models that can be used as role prompts to spark the pair design flow. The three are: Generator & Synthesizer, Lead & Support, and Cross-Disciplinary Pairs, each taking a different view on the collaboration.

**Nina Mehta** did a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537rbDd1MpA&t=127s) on pair design that has a recap in **[How to pair design (and convince your boss to invest in it)](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-pair-design/)**. It's great getting some insights on how roles differ between driver and navigator, tips on setting up pairs through Figma's multiplayer and how to approach designing in pairs. What's extra nice are the few tips about how to talk about the advantages of pair design to leadership if they are not convinced yet.

**[On Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)** is a quite detailed description of engineers approach working in pairs by **Birgitta B√∂ckeler** and **Nina Siessegger**. Since pair design has it's roots in Extreme Programming's pair programming practice, it's worth a read to get a different perspective on what's happening in such a collaboration. The article gives some guidance on the technical setup and tools (like deskspace to accommodate two persons, time and energy management) developers use, the differences between longer and shorter engagements, and a lot of practical tips.
