# ‚òï  Pair design

While collaboration is the way to go, the reality is, that most design still happen in maker time, a lone researcher or designer leaning over a piece of paper, a table or a Figma canvas. But often this doesn't lead to the most creative outputs.

A way to increase design quality

Also helps in articulation - as ideas need to immediately spelled out. 

Generator, synth - or researcher and designer for fixed roles.

Roots in pair programming (according to XP it's...)

Think about roles, even create role cards if that helps.

Great for reseerachers to collaborate and bring in user insights.

For design leaders the practice of pair design is an opportunity to get better design. How to do this? Selecting pairs from the team to collaborate regurarly. Pair from different fields. Pair seniors with less seniors. Pair researchers with designers - different skills. 

Lowers "designer loneliness" - since product team strucutre usually has designers work alone, this is a good practice to increase collab and shared learning.

# üç™ Things to snack on

The single best resource about this topic is the **[Pair Design](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pair-design/9781492042907/)** book by **Gretchen Anderson** and **Christopher Noessel** ([article version](https://www.oreilly.com/content/pair-design/)). 

**[Pair Design in practice](https://uxdesign.cc/%EF%B8%8F-pair-design-in-practice-2467eb4004e7)** by **Tom Kupka** is a pretty good case study on how they started pair designing, how they set up the process, ow roles changed over the phases of the design process and some nice learnings. 

**[Pairaphors: Explaining pair design (metaphorically)](https://christophernoessel.medium.com/pairaphors-explaining-pair-design-metaphorically-7ebdaee70bf3)** by **Christopher Noessel** what takes a lot of energy sometimes is to figure out the exact role for the two designers working in pairs. This lists a few metaphors for Cooper's Generator & Synthesizer model. Pilots & Navigators, Artists & Producers, Mulder & Scully.

**[3 Different Models Of Pair Design](https://mariyayao.com/3-models-pair-design/)** by **Mariya Yao** lists three models for pair design, this could be broadly used as role descriptions to spark the pair design flow. The three are: Generator & Synthesizer, Lead & Support, and Cross-Disciplinary Pairs. 

**[How to pair design (and convince your boss to invest in it)](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-pair-design/)** by **Nina Mehta** ([also, talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537rbDd1MpA&t=127s)) describes the model as driver and navigator with notes how these roles differ. Also gives a few tips on how to setup pair design through Figma's multiplayer and how to approach design pairing. What's extra nice are the few tips about how to talk about the advantages of pair design to leadership.

**[On Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)** by **Birgitta B√∂ckeler** and **Nina Siessegger**. A quite detailed description of the pair programming practice. Since pair design has it's roots in Extreme Programming's pair programming practice, it's worth a read to understand some of the details on what's happening in such a collaboration, technical and other tools (like deskspace, time and energy management) to set up for example if pairing is a longer engagement not just couple of hours and lot of practical tips (for example celebrating successes).
