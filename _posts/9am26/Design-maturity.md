# ‚òï Maturity

A quite challenge thing for design leaders is to understand where they are. Ther are always fires to put out, but once obvious improvements are done, it might unclear how we are doing. This is where maturity models might help, they act as a benchmark and heuristic on what's next, help form a vision.

A hauristic to consider baseline, where are we?

Research shoould be a key driver.


I find it a very interesting parallel to career ladders: we have aspects (competencies to aim for) and stages (levels like junior and senior), just as career ladders, the information is more of a snapshot, while growth is continuous. A difference is, that's much less clearer what needs to be done, and maturity models work for a whole organization, things are more specific and need to be more nuanced.

# üç™ Things to snack on

[**10 Reasons Why UX Maturity Matters**](https://natealan.medium.com/10-reasons-why-ux-maturity-matters-83af68bc5f4c) is a good list of points how UX maturity affects the broader business by **Nate Schloesser**. This can be a starting point for discussions on why the team need to spend time working on maturity, though the premise of the article is more UX maturity = better UX, which is not always true. 

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅ∫</p>

The most influential and well-known UX maturity model is **Nielsen Norman Group**'s [The 6 Levels of UX Maturity](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/), which has 6 stages in its current iteration, while focusing on 4 aspects: Strategy, Culture, Process and Leadership. There are tons of details on the stages and aspects which provide some pointers on how to use their model. 

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅ∫</p>

While the *Org Design for Design Orgs* book by **Peter Merholz** and **Kristin Skinner** doesn't have an explicit maturity model, they identified what makes successful design teams in [**12 qualities of effective design organizations**](https://www.oreilly.com/content/12-qualities-of-effective-design-organizations/) grouped into three aspects: Foundation, Output, and Management. These qualities broadly describe a mature team's behaviors. 

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅ∫</p>

[**The New Design Frontier**](https://s3.amazonaws.com/designco-web-assets/uploads/2019/01/The-New-Design-Frontier-from-InVision-012919.pdf) is **Invision**'s model created some time back, when Invision was still relevant. Compared to other models, their comprehensive approach (data is from tons of companies surveyed) along with the details makes this model useful, though the stages are more tactics-focused. The model has 3 aspects (People, Practices, and Platforms), along with sub-aspects and 5 stages. Since the model is benchmarked with industry data, at least the current stage can be put into context.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅ∫</p>

With so many maturity models, it's easy to lose track. Luckily, **Natalie Hanson** collected 12 of them in one place in [**UX Maturity Models ‚Äì A¬†Collection**](https://nataliehanson.com/2017/02/13/ux-maturity-models/). The article also makes an important point about how the audience (executives vs design team) should shape the language and the details highlighted when using a maturity model.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅ∫</p>

A challenge with using maturity models is, once a baseline is established, how to get granular information on how things are going. **John Kille** shows a method for this in [Creating and Implementing a Scorecard System to Increase Organizational User Experience Maturity](http://uxpamagazine.org/creating-and-implementing-a-scorecard-system-to-increase-organizational-user-experience-maturity/). This system focuses on evaluating efforts on the product team level, using a few high level questions focused on user-centricity. This approach also seems like a good way to start the conversation, it's small enough to be easily doable, while it starts people thinking about the broader need for increased maturity.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅ∫</p>

With maturity models, usually the question is how to progress to higher levels. [**How did I elevate my team‚Äôs UX maturity level?**](https://maitraudit.medium.com/how-did-i-elevate-my-teams-ux-maturity-level-ec010a724cc0) by **Udit Maitra** is a great case study detailing exactly this. Once their team identified where they are, a plan emerged from the discussions about what the score means for the team and that resulted in what actions to take (love the abbreviation here, IPA). 

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅ∫</p>

**Peter Merholz** shared recently a critique of maturity models in [**On the (f)utility of design maturity models**](https://www.petermerholz.com/blog/on-the-futility-of-design-maturity-models/), stating they are oversimplified and generally not that usable as an actionable tool for setting the strategy. But aside from this, the article gives some tips on how to use these models as a leader to determine how to engage with an organization. 

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅ∫</p>

Depending on how the team views research, it might get a back seat in maturity discussions, but in fact it should be the main driver of improving maturity. **Matthew Godfrey** writes about a specific aspect of this in [**Why research is key to an organisation‚Äôs design maturity**](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/why-research-is-key-to-an-organisations-design-maturity-fb0277082a0f). As the team matures towards taking a more strategic role, making insights a key part of what design is doing is a necessary step.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅ∫</p>

**dscout**'s [**Moves to Modern Research: A New Maturity Model for User-Centric Organizations**](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/moves) is a good example of a focused maturity model, this time on research. The model has 6 aspects of research work: Scope, Approach, Talent, Structure, Tempo, and Output, and has three stages detailed for each along with further resources from their excellent People Nerds blog.

<p style="text-align: center;">üÅ∫</p>

[**The New Research Landscape**](https://maze.co/resources/research-maturity-report/) by **Maze** is another research maturity model. This model has three aspects: People, Process, and Impact with five stages. In addition to the model description, the report has some advice on how to progress, a longer section on the advantages of higher maturity and a broader industry outlook based on the survey responses they've collected.

If you are thinking about creating your own maturity model, [**Your new (generated) maturity model**](https://maturity-model.online/) is a fun little tool to generate funny but sometimes useless names. Recommended checking out after spending some time in your LinkedIn feed, reading takes on maturity.
