## Writing stories

When writing a story about a project I often advocate for the [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result) narrative model, but found that while the overall structure is clear, it's difficult to find the right details to make note of.

The [Personal post-mortem](https://uxdesign.cc/personal-post-mortems-a-designers-checklist-for-every-ux-project-f1cc6828c35c) seems a good tactic to get the details in order before forming a narrative structure. This seems to be also part of the reflection process that preceeds writing the story. This method asks questions organised into four areas:

- Process
  - How did you frame the problem?
  - What was your process?
  - Why did you choose this approach?
  - How did you learn what you needed to know?
  - What kind of research was needed?
  - How did you integrate the data or insights?
- Deliverables
  - Given the usual set of constraints, are you honestly happy with the quality of what was delivered?
  - Was the wireframe/prototype/mock/flow/other up to scratch?
  - Did you account for all the details?
  - Were stakeholders happy with the result?
  - Would you put it in a portfolio?
- Behaviours
  - Were you flexible when things changed? (Because they always do!)
  - Did you listen to stakeholder concerns and acknowledge their feedback?
  - Did you truly empathize with their point of view?
  - Would they work with you again?
  - If you had concerns, could you communicate them effectively?
  - Did you pay attention, follow through, organize your work, and prioritize appropriately?
- Feelings
  - Did you enjoy this project? Why?
  - Was it easy, neutral or difficult?
  - Was the workload too much or not enough?
  - What was the best thing about this project?
  - What was the biggest challenge?
