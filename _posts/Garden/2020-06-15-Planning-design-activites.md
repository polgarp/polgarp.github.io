## Setting goals

We frequently get goals from product and the rest of the organisation that could be interpreted as "business results". And successful designers seem to be talking a lot about imrpoving conversion etc. But this feels like half the story, as we are optimising small interactions, rather than making meaningful changes and improvements to the experience - so real user behavior change. Jared Spool's [article on UX outcomes](https://articles.uie.com/why-ux-outcomes-make-better-goals-than-business-outcomes/) offers a solution to this. Just ask **If we do a fantastic job delivering this project, how will that improve the userâ€™s life?**.
