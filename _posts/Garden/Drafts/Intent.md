Product designer tasks can be broadly grouped into two parts.

First, rendering of intent. This is generally how design is described, but also might be not only referring to design itself, for example coding is rendering intent although into a different medium and coding often renders intent that is already rendered by design.

Second figuring out what the intent is, and more precisely figuring out what the shared intent is of the team working together - that is creating shared understanding and then facilitating decisions.

So creating a shared intent, and rendering that intent.
