- Projects go bad when functions are not clear, and not without consequences.
- Design your own role, each staff is different. You can work while floating between teams, talk to senior leadership to convince for additional people, but also execute things on your own.
 - Think across the org problems and impact, like platforms (for engineering it's base systems)

 mvps are iterative not incremental
 MVPs are as prototypes, target the right fidelty
