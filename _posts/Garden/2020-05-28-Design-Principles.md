## Formulating design principles

The definition for design principles is usually to have a headline and some explanation. This requires very focused writing and editing and may prove less useful in all the contexts. A simple structure we came up with:

- Principle name - start with a verb. Starting with a name gives an easy scheme and makes things a bit more actionable.
- One sentence of high level description. The best is 1 "over" statement talking about the chief trade off we are making. This makes it clear what we are choosing with this principle and what not. [(Even) over statements](https://academy.nobl.io/how-to-write-a-strategy-your-team-will-remember/) are super powerful and make also the description easy to remember.
- One sentence of explanation why it makes sense for our company. So we don't have fluffy designery statments, but something more concrete that also makes the principle usable to other departments, not only design.
- 2-3 examples on how this would manifest in the field. Design principles tend to be fairly high level, which is fair as you'd want to stay fairly high level to allow for a broad range of design solutions. But this might also means it will be hard to interpret in some cases, so examples help. These can stay on a mid level, so describe how the principle would apply to a login process, without prescribing solutions. Examples can also talk about existing good places where this principle is already applied within the product.
