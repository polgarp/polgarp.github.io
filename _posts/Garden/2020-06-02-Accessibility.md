## Accessibility audit

- There are no easy way around to make an [audit](https://medium.com/@krisrivenburgh/the-ada-checklist-website-compliance-guidelines-for-2019-in-plain-english-123c1d58fad9). 
  - ADA compliance is practically referred to as being compliant to [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). *The WCAG 2.0 AA success criteria are comprised of 38 requirements (including level A), individually referred to as success criterion.*
  - Recommendation is to meet as many success criteria the best we can. Accesibility is something we need to constantly work on, and total compliance is more an ideal than reality. ADA also gives some flexibility to private entitites. 
  - [2.1 is 2.0](https://medium.com/@krisrivenburgh/wcag-2-0-vs-2-1-aa-how-to-view-them-legally-and-accessibility-wise-4f18cfa2367a) + 12 more success criteria, mostly around mobile usage. Usually 2.0 is referenced as the standard.
  - *"There is a separate set of legal best practices to ADA compliance as well: training, having a web accessibility policy page, making a [web accessibility statement](https://medium.com/@krisrivenburgh/web-accessibility-policy-page-example-template-to-model-e7e8519ea124), appointing an accessibility coordinator, hiring an independent consultant, and inviting feedback."*
- [You want to go for](https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/ada-compliance-levels/) [AA compliance](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/website-accessibility-checklist/), this gives access to most users. [AAA compliance](https://userway.org/blog/what-are-wcag-20-a-aa-and-aaa) is not realistic in most cases, and has a [high impact](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-wcag-made-3-level-aa-aaa-different-levels-grade-website-arun-al/) on the website design.
- EUÂ´s accessibility standard is also based on WCAG: [EN 301 549](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf).
