## About personas

The [Spotfiy article](https://spotify.design/article/the-story-of-spotify-personas) talked about personas being [boundary objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_object). Meaning while there is a core piece of the artifact that is same across different context of uses, but the use depends on the context, possibly the interpretation in the different context. Very similar to how stories work - core is the same but retelling depends on the teller and the listeners. For product organisations this means there is a core part of the persona that stays the same for the whole organisation, but each team will have a different way of understanding. 

So:

 - We have to make sure the core is very explicit, doesn't leave too much to the imagination.
 - There is space within the persona that teams need to fill out themselves.
 
How to do this? Maybe provide space within the description of the persona itself for additional notes (called "team notes" even). Maybe there are 2-3 layers even, core is the same for everyone, 1st layer is different per organisation (for marketing, for product etc) and 2nd layer is different per teams.
