This is the second post in a series that [**Greg**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregprickril/) and I are publishing on the strategic role of UX in product development and how PMs and UX professionals can deliver greater impact via strategic alignment. [**Previously**](https://www.coachpms.com/post/ux-pm-a-strategic-duo) 

Product and UX strategies are tightly bound on two levels: organizational and product.  

The organizational strategy describes how we reach business goals and support business motivation across multiple products. This would include a broader mission, vision, values, and key customer segments and markets. While the organizational strategy supports business motivation, it’s in turn supported by the product strategies. 

An org-level UX strategy could be “Consistent mobile experience across portfolio” or “Recognized as an industry leader in user happiness”. 

The product strategies will be defined by both the high-level strategy, for example, to discover and deliver certain roadmap elements, or support organizational goals like improving branding consistency or maturing the discovery process. This would include the offering’s value proposition, key features, and target audience. 

A product-level strategy supporting the above org-level strategies would go into details like “Mobile apps updated to new design system“, or “Get 50% of our customers leave positive reviews on G2”. 

What ties together all is the definition of success, how do we know when we are winning? Defining aligned goals is key. Frameworks, such as CASTLE for B2B or HEART for B2C are useful, but not enough. Product management and UX design need to work together. 

In the next installment in this series, Greg will talk about how strategies from the organizational and product levels link together.
