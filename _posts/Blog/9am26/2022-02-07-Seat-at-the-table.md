# What does it mean having a seat at the table

Seat at the table - actually also means you are sitting at the table as design leader. So less design work, more management work, less crafting pixels, more creating and doing presentations, less design critiques, more slidedecks.

Share design aspect for projects. Bring input, estimate outcome.

Frist team mentality: whoever is with you on leadership meetings, you'd work with them more, than your design team.

Much depends on how we view ourselves. Do we have strategy we are executing for example - so does it makes sense to have a design strategy? For some companies it does, for most companies it's wrapped into product (or even marketing) strategy.

Think about ways how design affects other organisations. Think about how design is affected by other organisations.

Pitch and drive key projects: user research, design systems, redesigns

Design has a seat at the table, once companies vision includes UX.

Be open, sometimes it doesn’t work and UX doesn’t get a seat at the table. It’s ok, as long as there is a focus on the users.

Design is woven into every aspect.

Seat at the table means different things in various levels. On a product team level it means.. On an organisation level it means... on a company level it means.

You can have a design strategy, like being more user focused that goes beyond usual practice - this is something that is translateable or can be aligned to company vision.
