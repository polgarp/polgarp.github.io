Knowing what good looks like separates mediocre designers from great designers. And it's not just having a vague, high level, abstract, by-the-book idea of good, but a messy, close relationship, acknowledging the details and indeed being energized to to get the good. It's the driving force behind the optimism that the world can be indeed changed for the better. 

I wrote earlier about [good design]({% post_url 9am26/2023/2023-02-06-What-is-good-design %}), but good goes beyond the immediate outcomes design teams create. While a design team owns what good design is in a broader organization, creating good on all the levels comes down to the designers in the team, and how they operate on different levels of work.

Good can be described on multiple aspects of work, and since it's such a general idea, it takes different forms, and we describe it with different terms. For example for design quality good is often referred to as having taste, while for process it's described as being structured or organized. 

The shape of good changes as people progress in their career. More experienced does mean deeper knowledge on the details of good or how to get to a state of good, but the connection to good seems fairly constant.

There is the hunger of doing better for juniors: seeing more things, learning, trying out things to see what sticks. 

For mid levels it's having experience in good things by seeing the examples first hand.

Seniors it's about how to make good things happen.



 As the shape of good changes as one's career progresses, I also see constantly new signals of good. Here I'm collecting some examples on what I've seen sofar as good looks like.

**1on1s**

- For the manager: being able to connect to reports challenges and problems, and offer a way or realization to move ahead that is beyond the immediate frame, and gets to the objective.
- For the report: it's feeling energised, motivated, more confident in what needs to be done. And also a bit more stretched for the challenges ahead, guided to the centre of one's stretch zone.

Leaders,both being senior members in a team and owning the way forward are expected to show what good looks like. Giving examples
