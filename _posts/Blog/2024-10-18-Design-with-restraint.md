**Christopher K Wong** in [Why you shouldn’t be too eager to share your work](https://dataanddesign.substack.com/p/why-you-shouldnt-be-too-eager-to):

> …most Product teams (and executives) want you to deliver visual screens and prototypes as quickly as possible.
> This is why companies like Figma market “Generate a design” based on AI prompts to Product Managers, and Product Managers gaslight you into working faster: they want fast visual results.
> Most teams don’t realize that this results in “Fast + Cheap” Designs, which are a waste of time.
> Learning to push back and show restraint with visuals gives you enough time to create “Good + Fast” work instead.

> to obtain what you need to do the job correctly, you need to restrict access to your visuals.
> When you say, “I need to learn more about X to generate the mockup,” your Manager might listen and quickly get you access to those resources. However, if you ask that same question but you’ve handed over your prototype, you often might get a vague answer and pushed to the back burner.

Share early and often is still right, but the right things need to be shared at the right time to move the process forward. Exercising restraint also helps in collaboration as it opens up to feedback and invites input. It's a balance with design provocation (sharing visuals about a new direction early).
