My sets of principles on how we do things.

Principles for product design

- Everything should have a clear reason. Every research, every design decisions. Reasons should flow within the design process.

Principles for design teams

- Heist teams win
- Spaces for creation, spaces for production
- Everything is a prototype, we aim to learn

Principles for leadership
 
- Lead with context
- Every designer is a leader. Radical transparency helps them to learn from you.
