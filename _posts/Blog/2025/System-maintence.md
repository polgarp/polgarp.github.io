I liked this framework I learned about today. Think on well-being as system maintenance (similar to if you don't schedule maintaining your equipment, your equipment will schedule maintenance for you, you will get sick if you don't spend time on yourself). There is four types of maintenance:Â 

* Corrective (fixing current problems)
* Preventative (avoid future problems)
* Adaptative (to re-adjust to changes)
* Perfective (to work towards a better system)
