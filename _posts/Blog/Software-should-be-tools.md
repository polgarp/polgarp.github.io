I've been using computers for a long time.
 
- Started in the 8bit era, had a C-64, (though mostly played games) a computer that had endless opportunities to conjure up new things from thin air.
- Switching to a PC opened new worlds, you could create anything with it with the software available, music, images, programs that did what you wanted.
- With the more accessible internet came new opportunities to connect to others and learn new things. Each update to services brought new things to do, and software became even more useful to do things, each version a better tool.

Maybe I'm getting old, but at one point things started to break. Software is not getting better all the time anymore. Update and new apps don't enable me to do new things, better things, more things. Besides a few exceptions, new software is kinda the same at best - but most of the time it's worse. Software is not a tool anymore that's getting better.

As somebody working on software design (user research, UX design, interaction design, product design), I find this weird. With the effort spent by hundreds of thousands of smart people, software should become better, right? But it somehow doesn't.

Software should be a tool that helps the users - helps me to do better things. But it somehow doesn't. Reading some time ago about Cory Doctorow's [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/tag/enshittification/) clicked with me. In short, it's about *how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.*

It seems to me, this goes beyond platforms and is true to more and more software. But the problem is not something inherent to how software is created, rather how organizations exist around software creation. 

It's fine for companies to make money out of software, but it should be through adding value through making things and making things better, rather than strip mining value from people. By extracting value from people's time, attention, energy. By extracting value from people's lack of deep knowledge on how software works.

A lot of the software made right now is not great as tools, or at least tools for people. They don't allow people to use them without harm to themselves. They don't allow people to use them to fit them best. They don't allow people to use them for their best benefit. Of course they might be good tools for companies. 

People making software need to do better. Especially us designers who claim to be human-centered. We should create tools that help people to do things, rather than keep people from doing things in a good way. 

One of the earliest core ideas in human-centered design I've learned was that computers should work for people and not the other way around. So software tools, websites, apps shouldn't make people to do things their way. This goes beyond "common sense" UX.
