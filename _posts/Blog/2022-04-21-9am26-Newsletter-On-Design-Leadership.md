I'm starting a (bi)weekly newsletter on design leadership called **[9am26](https://polgarp.com/categories/newsletter/)**. Looking around the interwebs these days there are more and more good articles on leading and scaling design teams. So why am I adding one more to those? Two reasons: for myself to learn and for others to have good reference / starting points.

Why 9am26? I imagine myself and design leaders starting their day. After going through the slack, emails and finishing the first cup of coffee, it's almost half past nine. We would need to figure out which problem to work on today. There are always many things to figure out at any point in time. It could be about finding good team ceremonies, new practices to adopt, increasing maturity, growing talented ICs and managers... the list is endless. Getting an email with a good starting point at this time helps in setting a course.

So in short I intend to focus each issue on a specific topic, adding a few curated links with a short primer laying out some ideas. This should help in getting new ideas and levelling up the leadership game.
