I'm starting a (bi)weekly newsletter on design leadership called **[9am26](https://polgarp.com/categories/newsletter/)**. Looking around the interwebs these days there are more and more good articles on leading and scaling design teams. So why am I adding to those? Three reasons: for myself to learn, for others to have good starting points and to start conversations.

Why 9am26? I imagine a design leader starting their day. After going through the slack, emails and finishing the first cup of coffee, it's almost half past nine. They need to decide which problem to work on today. There are always many things to figure out at any one point in time. It could be about bettering team ceremonies, finding new practices to adopt, increasing maturity, growing talented ICs and managers... the list is endless. Getting an email with a good starting point helps in setting a course.

So I intend to focus each issue on a specific topic, adding a few curated links with a short primer laying out ideas on which directions to go. This should help in getting new ideas and levelling up the leadership game for design leaders just starting out - or for experienced design leaders finding new ways to improve. Or even for senior designers looking to get into a leadership.
