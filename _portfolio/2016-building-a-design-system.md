When I joined Emarsys, the product had a new look but lacked a unified design language. This page-by-page redesign created a fragmented user journey and resulted in a confusing experience. My challenge was to work the engineering team, nurture our design system, and **unify our interaction patterns to create a coherent user journey** and improve usability.

The engineering team had already built a great UI kit from the new designs, but it provided little guidance on how to use each element effectively. I saw an opportunity to bring our design and development teams together. We started to use the **Atomic Design framework** to structure our work, with detailed interaction guidelines to unify our components, providing the team with a direction for building a cohesive experience.

I led the UX team in recreating all of our elements to speed up our design work, but my priority was building cross-functional alignment. I worked directly with product managers, developers, and designers to **build a shared understanding** of our design principles and guidelines. We started to not only unify and improve components but also created higher-level patterns to ensure a consistent experience across the app.

Recognizing the importance of this work, I successfully advocated for **a dedicated Design System team** composed of engineers, designers, and researchers. This initiative became a core part of our design practice. This experience taught me that **building a design system is not just about assets, it's about building a strong, cross-functional team that can effectively scale a product and its vision.**
