When I first realized that as a computer science major instead of programming big black boxes, I’d rather work with people, I started to read everything that had even a slight connection to this topic. After reading all the Alertbox posts available online, I realized that **great design is not only about understanding UX, it's also helping others to make better products.** My journey into design leadership began with this simple idea: to truly master a subject, you must be able to teach it.

So I went back to my university and started to teach software ergonomics to other computer science students. I continue to teach and evangelize UX in some ways ever since.

Besides teaching, I also **started to write, I was one of the first bloggers writing in Hungarian about UX**. That’s how I met other people who were also working in this field. It turned out we need more time to talk, My desire to connect with and grow the community led me to co-found the [UX Budapest meetup](https://www.meetup.com/UXbudapest/). What began as ten people grabbing a beer to talk about user needs quickly grew into a [large community of professionals](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594600877237593/about/). **This experience taught me how to shape a passionate group into a collaborative community, laying the groundwork for how I build design teams today.**

I stopped being an organizer of the meetup, but I do **smaller design thinking workshops** now and then. In my workshops and courses, I focus on the methods that are central to my leadership philosophy. We explore **user research and discovery** to make better product decisions, and practice **collaborative design** to foster the kind of teamwork needed to **design coherent user journeys**.

My overall mission remains the same: I believe that **leadership is about being a force multiplier**. By inspiring, teaching, and enabling others, I continue to learn and strengthen my ability to build strong design teams and work with the broader community.
