When I first realized that as a computer science major instead of programming big black boxes, I’d rather work with people, I started to read everything that had even a slight connection to this topic. After reading all of the Alertbox posts available online, **I knew I’ll only understand usability / UX well enough if I can also explain it to others**. So I went back to my university and started to teach software ergonomics to other computer science students. I continue to teach and evangelize UX in some way ever since.

Besides teaching, I also **started to write, I was one of the first bloggers writing in Hungarian about UX**. That’s how I met other people who were also working on this field. It quickly turned out we need more time to talk, so with others I started to organize World Usability Day events, and later **the [UX Budapest meetup](https://www.meetup.com/UXbudapest/)** series. It evolved into a [huge community of professionals](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594600877237593/about/), especially thinking back at the humble beginning of 10 UXers going out to have a beer and talking about user needs and testing.

I stopped being an organizer of the meetup, but I do **smaller design thinking workshops** every now and then. In the past years I also teach on [UX courses](http://momeid.mome.hu/) where I **talk about user research, usability testing, collaborative design and the Lean UX approach**. Besides this I’m often asked to talk at meetups ([for example about designing for AI](https://www.meetup.com/UXbudapest/events/243139012/)) and also mentor beginners (for example at [UX Coffee hours](http://uxcoffeehours.com/)). But my overall agenda stayed the same: to continue learning, I must be able to inspire and explain things to others, so I keep improving my evangelization game.
