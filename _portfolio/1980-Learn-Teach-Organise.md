When still at the university as a computer science major I realized I'm the most interested in how software gets used and bring value to people. So I started to read and learn and pick new courses that matched my interest. During my own studies, I also understood, that **great design is not only about understanding UX, it's also helping others to make better products.** My journey into design leadership began with this simple idea: to truly master a subject, you must be able to teach it.

So I teach software ergonomics to other computer science students to spread what I already had learned. I continue to teach and advocate for UX in some ways ever since.

Besides teaching, I also **started to write, I was one of the first bloggers writing in Hungary about UX**. Thatâ€™s how I met other people who were also working in this field. It turned out we need more time to talk. My desire to connect with and grow the community led me to co-found the [UX Budapest meetup](https://www.meetup.com/UXbudapest/). What began as ten people grabbing a beer to talk about user needs quickly grew into a [large community of professionals](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594600877237593/about/). **This experience taught me how to shape a passionate group into a collaborative community, laying the groundwork for how I build design teams today.**

I stopped being an organizer of the meetup, but I do **smaller design thinking workshops and teach on courses** now and then. In my workshops and courses, I focus on the methods that are central to my leadership philosophy. We explore **user research and discovery** to make better product decisions, and practice **collaborative design** to foster the kind of teamwork needed to **design coherent user journeys**.

My overall mission remains the same: I believe that **leadership is about being a force multiplier**. By inspiring, teaching, and enabling others, I continue to learn and strengthen my ability to build strong design teams and work with the broader community.
