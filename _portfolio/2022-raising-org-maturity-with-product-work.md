TBD.

Krisp has been a noise cancellation app, with the ambition of improving the overall effectiveness of communicators - so going beyond clarity, and also act as a speech coach. We had access to the audio stream and were thinking on real time improvements. To test this, the idea was to give a small summary at the end of the call - this way, we can get feedback if the idea is sound, what people are interested in and we realised that real-time feedback is harder to design, so this was faster to test and contributed to our overall hypothessis.

While the members of the team were already experienced, as an organization we didn't had too much experience how to do continuous discovery, integrate user research results into product decisions, and iteratively learn about user needs or product features. Since I had experience with reasearch, discovery practices and the dual track agile process, I took the challenge in the product work to also expand how the team could collaborate and think about discovery to improve the efficiency of our work.

We designed the project in two rounds, first just to show talk time, second round also adding talk pace and filler words used.

First round: establish tech infrastructure, use existing mechanisms and tech as much as possible. Had some arguments with the PM if this should be just feedback or also go viral - after release saw many people sharing on social media, so it did get some viral traction.

Second round more tricky, also needed to balance attention and figure out how to not only tell data, but also judgments, so start giving feedback. With talk pace it's easy, with filler words we did some research what would be acceptable cases. Also there were concerns about accuracy, so had to give some asterixes over the interfaces.

Both times: rapid iterations, check with engineering and lightweight testing - that allowed us to learn and discover about all aspects of the solution: feasibility (we applied new machine learning algortihms), value (would users use this and get better over time), usability (is the feature at the right place in the user flow, do users come back for more), and fit (does this fit with the overall company directions.). We Discussed extensively these aspects at each step, and collected data points for our standing hyptoheses. 

Process - check competitors, check with stakeholders, rapidly explore open questions and variations with quick design, while keeping feasibility as much in check as possible via talking to engineers. Also keeping our principles in mind - don't overwhelm the user.

Finally after a promising beta, the company decided to pivot the product strategy and go for a different opportunity, and roll-out was halted. Our results contributed to the understanding how such features as fit would evolve.

What was interesting how we evolved our process as we went. Initial was: PM did PRD, and design came afterwards. This didn't allow for a lot of discovery, was output based, with not a lot of collaboration and overall showed a fairly low maturity. We iterated on the process multiple times, and finally the design happened parallel to PRD, as we not only explored the product, but also our understanding how we could get more efficiently to quick solutions.
