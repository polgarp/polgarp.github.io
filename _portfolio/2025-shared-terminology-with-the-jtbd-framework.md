The start was a stream, 
Now a river, wide and deep, 
I can't see the shore.

Notes:
Company has a wide portfolio, while serving the same audience, needs are fairly context dependent. Engagement with community and plenty of dogfooding, noticed a good common understanding of our audience and what they do, and also various orgs having problems transmitting learnings about users to each other. So started a project with the marketing teeam to describe our audience with the JTBD framework. As the first round was successful, we expaned and made it a project within the design team, to create a set of articles, and also a standard way of working with JTBD, personas, journeys to help marketing, sales, product, design. To make sure we are making meaningful change, in the next phase we defined the rigor for the approach and worked with one team to help their specific problem, doing both top down and bottom up.
