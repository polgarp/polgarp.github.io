As I led the newly formed UX team at Emarsys, I quickly identified a critical challenge: without a shared process, our designers were spending too much time on refining solutions and too little on research. This led to late-stage changes and a lack of clarity on when to apply the right methods. My goal was to provide a framework that would **empower the team to work more strategically and effectively**, while communicating clearly our approach to our partners.

To address this, I introduced a common UX process based on Design Council's Double Diamond model. I led the team in adapting it to fit our specific needs, ensuring it provided a flexible approach rather than a rigid set of rules. A key part of this new process was requiring a **design brief** to be created in the middle. This single artifact served as a bridge, forcing us to summarize our research and formally define the problem before jumping into solutions. This approach was crucial to **making better product decisions with discovery** and provided **a clear framework for how we'd work as a team**.

The results were clear: the process organized our activities and proved scalable for any project size. The design brief became a particularly powerful tool, giving our designers clear, focused goals. This experience taught me that **creating a flexible process is essential to building a high-performing design team** that fits the organization, and makes collaboration transparent to partners.
