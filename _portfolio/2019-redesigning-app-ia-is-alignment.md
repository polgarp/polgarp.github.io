When I joined Trustpilot, the product organization was struggling with a key challenge: a fragmented B2B app experience caused by autonomous teams working each on their own roadmap. Each team had its own menu item, each item screaming for attention, which created a confusing user journey, especially during onboarding. To solve this, I partnered with a product manager and their team to lead an information architecture project focused on redesigning the main menu.

{% include gallery caption="Creating alignment with IA" %}

Our core principle was simple: a better information architecture requires a better understanding of the organization and its users. To get everyone on the same page, we designed a strategic process with four parallel tracks, ensuring our solution would be both user-centered and internally aligned.
 - User research track: We wanted to understand how current users perceived the solution and intended to continuously test versions via usability testing, card sorting, and tree testing. This was our core discovery track.
 - Alignment track: We did workshops with all product teams, and most stakeholders over several weeks, understanding key concerns, ambitions, and expectations towards the new IA and getting buy-in. With some groups, we set up further workshops to understand how the new menus would impact their work.
 - Design track: We involved the entire design team to widen our solution space, proving that **great ideas come from a collaborative culture**.
 - Prototype track: We used a running prototype from day one to test our vision, turning abstract concepts into a tangible experience we could validate and refine.

I was working within each of these tracks in various ways to enable and support the individual contributors driving them.

After three months, we had a solution that was agreed upon by everyone, a testament to the power of our collaborative process. Our success was not just in improving traffic to key tasks and conversions but in proving that internal alignment through a **coherent user journey** is a strategic business driver. This project was core to my belief that **design leadership is about building the systems and teams that enable a product to scale effectively.**
