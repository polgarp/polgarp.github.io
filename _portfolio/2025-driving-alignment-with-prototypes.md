Words are on the page, 
A tale half-told, half-dreamed of, 
Waiting for the end.

Notes:
When I joined Canonical, we had a fragmented offering around Ubuntu Pro. Pieces were added at various times by various teams, not only not offering a coherent experience, but also keeping us from levelling up the offering.
First we did a journey map to see all the misalignment and how that affects the experience, and the various team's work.
Then we pitched a simple idea with a single hero image to showcase the experience. This had the intended effect, and it was decided to start working on the Portal project.
Developed user narratives to capture and set the problem space.
Developed a vision that showed the direction beyond the first PoC and MVP, also to coordinate the multiple teams and projects that were included.
