At Prezi, I was tasked with a particularly complex problem: designing for team collaboration. This was a complex challenge in **forming a single user journey** across multiple roles and team-based needs. We needed to support different users working together in a wide range of contexts, which meant our research had to go beyond individual user flows and test with entire groups.

The real challenge was making sure we were **learning about the value of our ideas as early and efficiently as possible**. To meet this goal, my designer partner and I developed a new process. We learned to match the fidelity of our prototypes directly to the questions we were trying to answer, from simple paper sketches for testing value to high-fidelity code for validating usability. This process was a direct result of my close collaboration with a designer partner. We pair designed to redefine our approach, proving that **effective design and discovery are a team sport**.

During this time I learned a lot on what is the best fidelity to test, and how to design tests and prototypes together to maximize learning. Part of this was to **understand how the difference between fidelities affects preparation for tests**, and what could be potential learning outcomes. Another insight was on how to create different prototypes, for example at one point I recreated our click-through mockups in Bootstrap, learning how to do it over 3 weekends. 

I synthesized these insights into a [conference talk](https://prezi.com/qfftsdxtojf0/from-lo-fi-to-hi-fi/) on prototyping at the UxLx conference, but the real takeaway was more profound: by **making our testing and prototyping more deliberate and strategic, we elevated our entire design practice**. This experience is core to my belief in the power of grounded, insight-driven product decisions.
