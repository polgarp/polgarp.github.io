I joined Emarsys not just **to lead it’s UX team**, but **also to establish the team and introduce the design practice into product development**. Before I joined Emarsys didn’t have a dedicated UX team, they worked with contractors and agencies. Product managers did some user research and mockups for their features. Even with the company open towards UX and a committed leadership, creating the team and injecting design into the development process was a great challenge.

I had three basic ideas on how to establish the team.

1. **Apply the Lean UX mindset** to everything we do, so experiment and learn on what the organization needs to bring the product forward.
2. **Establish researcher - designer** pairs based on the pair design practice by Cooper.
3. Make product teams superheroes by **embedding UX people with devs and PMs** ([the talk I did](https://prezi.com/rit0h4vvzql8/lean-ux-in-product-teams/) when introducing this).

Starting [with 2 people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG8FBnwci7k) and [hiring 14 more since then](https://blog.craftlab.hu/hiring-ux-people-at-emarsys-e12f5bfdd5fb), we work now on most of the product. I also **established key design practices** (with the support of my awesome team): design studios, critiques, frequent interviews and tests, design briefs, principles, remote design feedback over Invision, [user story maps](https://blog.craftlab.hu/drawing-houses-fb6893facfbe), [design sprints](https://medium.com/emarsys-design/running-the-design-sprint-at-emarsys-4b40a4cecc47), a design system. While doing this I learned, **an organization is very similar to the product**: you have to understand the needs and pain points of users (the rest of the organization) in order to create the best solutions.
