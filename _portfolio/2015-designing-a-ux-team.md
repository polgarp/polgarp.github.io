I joined Emarsys with a strategic mandate: to not only to **build and lead the new UX team**, but to **establish a design practice** and fully integrate it into the product development process. With no dedicated UX team previously, this was a significant challenge that required both a strong vision and a hands-on approach.

My approach to **building the right team** was guided by three core principles:

1. **Lean UX mindset:** We experimented and learned what design practices the organization needed to truly bring the product forward, treating the org itself like a product we had to understand and improve.
2. **Researcher-designer pairs:** I established the pair model to ensure our design work was always grounded in deep user understanding and a true collaborative partnership.
3. **Embedded UX people:** We integrated designers and researchers directly with developer and product teams into cross-functional teams. This empowered them to act as strategic partners and amplified their impact across the organization.

Through a disciplined approach to hiring and professional growth, we built a team of [16 talented UX professionals](https://blog.craftlab.hu/hiring-ux-people-at-emarsys-e12f5bfdd5fb). Together, we introduced a suite of practices that became the foundation of our work: **discovery and research** to make better product decisions (like frequent interviews and [design sprints](https://medium.com/emarsys-design/running-the-design-sprint-at-emarsys-4b40a4cecc47)), **visioning tools** like design principles and briefs, and **systems thinking** like our [design system]({% link _portfolio/2016-building-a-design-system.md %}) and [user story maps](https://blog.craftlab.hu/drawing-houses-fb6893facfbe) to **build coherent cross-product user journeys**.

In this role, I learned that design teams are very much like a product: you have to understand the needs of your 'users' (the rest of the organization) to create the best possible solutions. This experience also taught me that **design leadership is ultimately about building the systems, teams, and culture that enable great design and talented designers to thrive.**
