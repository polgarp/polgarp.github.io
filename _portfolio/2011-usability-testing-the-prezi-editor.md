Prezi, as a presentation startup offered many opportunities around the product when I joined. Along with separate desktop, web and mobile versions it has collaboration features and a unique interaction model. Instead of slides it offers an infinite, zoomable canvas. This is a difficult problem space to design for, and also provides many challenges in user research, especially in usability testing. We **had to experiment a lot with test methodology** to understand the shifts in the mental models of the users, their “aha” moments.

{% include gallery caption="Testing in various contexts, with various methods." %}

We realized early that we not only need frequent user sessions, but we have to have weekly recurring tests to understand how each interaction change impacts the overall experience. This means **hundreds of user sessions** in the team (and along them for me) improving our testing practice together. Since editing a prezi takes lots of creativity, we operated with **open tasks** to not limit the participants’ intentions, which made facilitation difficult and made us think a lot on how each word biased the users’ later actions.

I learned a lot about facilitation and also about different methods for testing products. We used at least a few times among others paper prototyping, eye tracking, remote tests, unmoderated tests, retrospective tests, 5 second tests, card sorting, diary studies, wizard of oz, guerilla testing, contextual tests. Plus to get this many participants all imaginable methods for recruiting. Finally **to have an impact** with all these insights lots of ways of getting info to the product team, like newsletters, mini talks, comics, t-shirts, posters.
