Prezi, as a presentation startup offered many opportunities around the product when I joined. Along with separate desktop, web, and mobile versions, it has collaboration features and a unique interaction model. Instead of slides, it offers an infinite, zoomable canvas. This is a difficult problem space, presenting unique challenges in understanding how users navigate a boundless canvas. My team and I had to **experiment constantly to truly understand their shifting mental models and "aha" moments.**

We realized early that we not only need frequent user sessions, but we have to have weekly recurring tests to understand how each interaction change impacts the overall experience. 

We quickly realized that only **a continuous and rigorous discovery practice** could keep pace with our product's rapid evolution. To truly understand how each interaction change impacted the overall experience, we committed to weekly testing, conducting **hundreds of user sessions** with the team, improving our testing practice together. Since editing a prezi takes lots of creativity, we operated with **open tasks** to not limit the participants’ intentions, which made facilitation difficult and made us think a lot about how each word biased the users’ later actions.

Through this process, I gained deep expertise in a wide range of discovery methods, from paper prototypes to eye tracking and guerrilla testing. But my biggest lesson was about impact. To ensure our insights were never siloed, we developed creative ways to get the information to the broader product team—through newsletters, comics, and mini-talks. **This was a foundational experience in making discovery a core, integrated part of our product development process.**
