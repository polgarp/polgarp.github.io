Krisp has been a noise cancellation app, with the ambition of improving the overall effectiveness of communicators - so going beyond clarity, and also act as a speech coach. We had access to the audio stream and were thinking on real time improvements. To test this, the idea was to give a small summary at the end of the call - this way, we can get feedback if the idea is sound, what people are interested in and we realised that real-time feedback is harder to design, so this was faster to test and contributed to our overall hypothessis.
