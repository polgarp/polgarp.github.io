[Garden]({% post_url 2015-12-06-stretchcon-2015-impressions %}), a place to collect notes, half formed ideas, a thinking tool to articulate ideas, an open storage to spark discussions.

I'm aiming my garden to act as a knowledge library on my broader journey as a design leader and design professional.
