[Garden]({% post_url Garden/2020-11-08-Garden %}), a place to collect notes, half formed ideas, a thinking tool to articulate ideas, an open storage to spark discussions.

I'm aiming my garden to act as a knowledge library on my broader journey as a design leader and design professional. I've described in a blog post [my knowledge workflow]({% post_url Blog/2021/2021-02-27-My-knowledge-workflow-2021 %}) that contains some notes how the garden should function.
