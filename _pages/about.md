So I'm on a journey to channel this energy to build better things. These days I believe better products are built by great teams. As it turns out, **I ❤️ building product design teams** - almost as much as building products.

Sometimes this means coaching and management, sometimes working with product teams to bring products from idea to users.

Currently, I'm a senior designer at [Canonical](https://canonical.com/). Previously managing partner at [Megis](https://megis.studio/), lead product designer at [Krisp.ai](https://krisp.ai), senior UX manager at [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/), head of UX at [Emarsys](https://emarsys.com/), and UX researcher at [Prezi](https://prezi.com/).
