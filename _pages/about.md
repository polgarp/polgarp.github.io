I help teams to by bringing products from idea till execution. I create great experiences by providing insights about the user needs and expectations, validating hypotheses and designing solutions.

I write sometimes about products and UX on [Medium](https://medium.com/@polgarp).

I write sometimes about products and UX in 280 characters on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/polgarp).
