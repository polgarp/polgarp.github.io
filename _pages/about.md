Iâ€™m Peter Balazs Polgar.

I help teams to bring products from the idea to be delivered to the users by providing insights about the needs and expectations, validating hypotheses and designing products. I also mentor and train others to do the same. Currently Senior UX manager Trustpilot, previously Head of UX @Emarsys and UX researcher @Prezi.

I write sometimes about products and UX on Medium.

I write sometimes about products and UX in 280 characters on Twitter.

I frequently do talks on meetups and various courses.
