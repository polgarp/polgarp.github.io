I’m Péter Balázs Polgár.

I help teams to bring products from the idea to be delivered to the users by providing insights about the needs and expectations, validating hypotheses and designing solutions. I also mentor and train others to do the same. Currently Senior UX manager at [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/), previously Head of UX at [Emarsys](https://emarsys.com/) and UX researcher [Prezi](https://prezi.com/).

I write sometimes about products and UX on [Medium](https://medium.com/@polgarp).

I write sometimes about products and UX in 280 characters on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/polgarp).

I frequently do talks on meetups, on various courses and I'm also open for [mentoring](http://uxcoffeehours.com/).
