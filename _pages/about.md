I’m Péter Balázs Polgár.

I love building product design teams. I also like to help product teams bringing products from idea till execution. I create great experiences by providing insights about the user needs and expectations, validating hypotheses and designing solutions. I also mentor and train others to do the same. Currently Lead Product designer at [Krisp.ai](https://krisp.ai), previously Senior UX manager at [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/), Head of UX at [Emarsys](https://emarsys.com/) and UX researcher at [Prezi](https://prezi.com/).

I write sometimes about products and UX on [Medium](https://medium.com/@polgarp).

I do talks on meetups and on various courses. I'm also open for [mentoring](http://uxcoffeehours.com/).
