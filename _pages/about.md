I'm super annoyed by bad experiences. So I resolved early to try and build better ones. These days I believe great teams build great products.

**I ‚ù§Ô∏è building product design teams.**
{: .notice--primary}

Sometimes this means coaching and management, sometimes working with product teams to bring products from idea to execution.

Currently bringing sustainability to companies and products at [Megis](https://megis.studio/). Previously Lead Product Designer at [Krisp.ai](https://krisp.ai), Senior UX Manager at [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/), Head of UX at [Emarsys](https://emarsys.com/), and UX Researcher at [Prezi](https://prezi.com/).
