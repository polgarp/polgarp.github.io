intro:
  - title: "I obsess about four things"
    excerpt: 'Impactful design leadership goes beyond the immediate product impact. It’s about building the systems that make great products possible & efficient. I drive teams to solve the right problems and create meaningful results with these four principles:<br><br>

    • Making better product decisions with discovery<br>
    • Building the right teams to deliver the right results
